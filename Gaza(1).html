<h1>Gaza humanitarian crisis (2023-present)</h1>

<h2>Wikipedia</h2>

<h3>March 9, 2024</h3>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>The Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian crisis as a result of the
Israel-Hamas war.[1][2] The crisis includes both a famine and a healthcare
collapse. At the start of the war, Israel implemented a complete blockade on
the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in significant shortages of fuel, food,
medication, water, and essential medical supplies.[1][3] This siege resulted
in a 90% drop in electricity availability, impacting hospital power
supplies, sewage plants, and shutting down the desalination plants that
provide drinking water.[4] Widespread disease outbreaks have spread across
Gaza.[2]

<p>Heavy bombardment by Israeli airstrikes caused catastrophic damage to Gaza's 
infrastructure, further deepening the crisis.[5] By mid-November, Israel had 
dropped the equivalent of two nuclear bombs on Gaza.[6] The Gaza Health
Ministry reported over 4,000 children killed in the war's first month.[7] UN
Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres stated Gaza had "become a graveyard for
children."[a][10][11]

<p>Organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, the Red Cross, and a joint 
statement by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the UN Development
Programme, United Nations Population Fund, and World Food Programme have
warned of a dire humanitarian collapse.[12][13][14] On November 8, UN Human
Rights chief Volker Turk described the Rafah Crossing as "gates to a living
nightmare."[15]

<h3>Food and water</h3>
<p>------------------------</p>

<p>The situation in the Gaza Strip reached dire levels of starvation and food 
insecurity by late 2023 and early 2024. Reports from various sources
including the World Food Programme and United Nations officials highlighted
a devastating situation where food stocks were nearly exhausted, bakeries
were being destroyed by Israeli airstrikes, and access to basic food
supplies became increasingly scarce.[18][19][20][21] By November, queues of
hundreds of people for bread became common, signaling a deepening
crisis.[22][23][24]

<p>As the conflict persisted, the Gaza Strip witnessed a worsening
famine,[25][26] with reports indicating that begging for food became
commonplace and hunger became pervasive among the population.[27] By
December, international aid organizations and relief workers sounded alarms
of mass starvation, with the majority of households facing inadequate food
consumption and a significant portion resorting to extreme measures to
survive.[28][29] Human Rights Watch accused Israel of using starvation as a
method of warfare in the occupied territory, further exacerbating the
humanitarian catastrophe.[30]

<p>By early 2024, the Gaza Strip faced one of the worst instances of man-made 
starvation in a century.[31][32] The chief economist at the World Food
Programme noted that the vast majority of people experiencing famine or
catastrophic hunger worldwide were concentrated in Gaza, emphasizing the
severity of the crisis.[33] Food prices rose in Gaza as food stock ran
out.[34] With limited aid entering the region and skyrocketing food prices,
the population continued to suffer, with children particularly vulnerable to
malnutrition and dehydration.[35] The international community expressed
grave concerns, acknowledging the pervasive shadow of starvation looming
over the people of Gaza and underscoring the urgent need for immediate
humanitarian intervention to avert further tragedy.[36][37]

<h3>Water Supply</h3>
<p>------------------------</p>

<p>Before the war Gaza purchased a small share of its water from Israel (6% in
2021).[38] Israel's blockade of water pipelines exacerbated water supply
issues in the Gaza Strip, which already had a near lack of fit-to-drink
aquifers.[39] On 12 October, the United Nations said that Israeli actions
had caused water shortages affecting 650,000 people.[40] On 14 October,
UNRWA announced Gaza no longer had clean drinking water, and two million
people were at risk of death.[41][42]

<p>On 15 October, Israel agreed to resume water supply, but only in southern
Gaza.[43] Because Gaza's water pumps require electricity, the agreement did
not ensure renewed water access.[44][45] On 16 October, Minister of Energy
Israel Katz said that water was available near southern Khan Younis, but the
Gaza Interior Ministry denied this.[46] By the same time, residents were
drinking seawater and brackish water from farm wells, raising fears of
waterborne diseases.[47][44] Doctors and hospital staff drank IV
solution.[48]

<p>By 17 October, the UN stated Gaza's last seawater desalination plant had
shut down.[49] The Guardian stated fears were growing people had begun to
die from dehydration.[39] On 18 October, Israel announced it would not allow
fuel to enter Gaza.[50] The UNRWA stated fuel was needed to resume water
pump operations.[50] Some Gazans purchased water from private vendors who
purified water with solar panels.[51] On 19 October, the UN reported Gazans
were surviving on a daily average of three liters of water each.[52] The
World Health Organization recommends a minimum of 50 to 100 liters per
day.[49] On 22 October, the UN stated Gazans had resorted to drinking dirty
water.[53] On 25 October, Oxfam announced Gaza had "virtually run out" of
water.[54] On 29 October, Palestinian Water Authority chair Mazen Ghoneim
stated the water shortage would be alleviated, as Israel reopened a second
water pipeline.[55]

<p>On 3 November, the UN stated many still relied on "brackish or saline ground 
water," if they were drinking any water at all.[56] On 6 November, OCHA
stated continued water shortages were raising fears of dehydration.[57]
UNRWA announced on 15 November that due to the lack of fuel, 70 percent of
Gaza would no longer have access to clean water.[58] On 17 November, Oxfam
stated Gaza's water supply was at seventeen percent of its pre-siege
capacity.[59] On 27 November, residents in northern Gaza received their
first aid delivery of clean water since the war began.[60] Doctors Without
Borders stated on 18 December the water system in Gaza had collapsed.[61]
UNICEF reported children in southern Gaza were receiving 1.5 liters of water
a day, while the minimum amount for survival is 3 liters per day.[62] 

<p>As of December 6, the sole water desalination facility in northern Gaza was 
inoperative, while the pipeline that delivers water from Israel to the north 
remained shut, thereby heightening the likelihood of dehydration and
waterborne illnesses due to the consumption of unsafe water sources. The
impact on hospitals has been severe, as only one out of the 24 hospitals in
northern Gaza is operational and capable of accepting new patients, albeit
with limited services, as of December 14.[30] 

<p>On 13 December, Israel began pumping seawater into tunnels reportedly used
by Hamas.[63] Experts warned this would irreversibly damage Gaza's water
aquifers and clearwater supply.[64] The IDF acknowledged it was flooding the
tunnels on 30 January.[65][66] In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed
Gaza City's main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.[67] The director of
ambulance and emergency centres for Gaza stated on 20 January that the
"struggle for water is a daily torment".[68] The UNOCHA director for Gaza
stated, "We can only meet a third of the population's need for clean
drinking water."[69]

<p>In February 2024, Palestinians in Gaza City were killed by an Israeli
airstrike while collecting water.[70] On 11 February 2024, the municipality
of Gaza reported 700 million liters of wastewater had leaked into the
streets of Gaza City, threatening underground water reserves.[71] On 28
February, the UN reported that up to one-fourth of Gaza's water wells had
been destroyed.[72] The Food and Agriculture Organization stated water was
at 7 percent of pre-October levels.[73] 

<h3>Disease</h3>
<p>------------------------</p>

<h4>November 8, 2023[74] </p>

<p>Public health experts warned of the outbreak and spread of disease in Gaza. 
According to Oxfam and the United Nations, Gaza's lack of clean water and 
sanitation would trigger a rise in cholera and other deadly infectious diseases.[75] 
Oxfam stated Gaza's sewage pumping stations and wastewater treatment facilities 
had ceased operations, so the buildup of solid waste and unburied bodies were 
likely vectors of disease.[75] Due to the lack of clean drinking water, Gaza 
residents were drinking water contaminated with sewage, seawater, and farm water, 
another major source of disease.[75] Richard Brennan, regional emergency 
director at WHO, stated, "The conditions are ripe for the spread of a number of 
diarrhoeal and skin diseases".[75] 

<p>Doctors also warned of overcrowded conditions at schools and hospitals. Dr. 
Nahed Abu Taaema stated overcrowded shelters were "a prime breeding ground for 
disease to spread".[76] Abu Taaema reported a rise in rashes, lung infections, 
and stomach issues.[76] On 24 October, the Gaza Health Ministry recorded 3,150 
cases of disease from drinking contaminated water, mostly among children.[77] 
The lack of medical supplies was another reported issue, as the World Health 
Organization reported a sanitation crisis in hospitals, with some struggling to 
sanitize surgical equipment.[78] Dr. Iyad Issa Abu Zaher stated, "The outbreak 
of disease is inevitable".[79] UNRWA schools, where an estimated 600,000 Gazans 
were sheltering, reported outbreaks of scabies and chicken pox, as well as a 
lack of basic hygiene for women menstruating.[80] On 27 October, Action Against 
Hunger warned people were developing kidney failure due to the consumption of 
salt water and dehydration.[81] 

<p>On 6 November, OCHA stated individuals with disabilities were suffering 
disproportionately due to the lack of accommodations in most shelters.[82] UNRWA 
announced cases of respiratory infections, diarrhoea and chicken pox had been 
reported at its shelters.[83] On 10 November, WHO stated infectious diseases, 
including diarrhea and chickenpox, were soaring across the Gaza Strip.[84] OCHA 
stated accumulated waste in the streets risked the spread of airborne diseases 
and infestations of insects and rats.[85] Doctors reported that due to a lack of 
fresh water and iodine, patients wounds were often infested with maggots.[86] 

<p>Raw sewage overflowed in the streets, creating a health and environmental 
disaster.[87] On 8 November, the World Health Organization stated that since the 
start of the conflict, 33,551 cases of diarrhea had been reported, 8,944 cases 
of scabies and lice, 1,005 cases of chickenpox, 12,635 cases of skin rash and 54,866 
cases of upper respiratory infections.[88] On 17 November, WHO updated these 
numbers, stating there were 70,000 cases of acute respiratory infections and 
over 44,000 cases of diarrhea, which were significantly higher than expected.[89] 
UNICEF warned the worsening sanitation situation threatened a mass disease 
outbreak.[90] 

<p>On 28 November, WHO stated more Palestinians risked dying from disease than 
bombings.[91] UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini warned of an impending humanitarian 
"tsunami" as people succumbed to disease and the deprivation of sanitation and 
clean water.[92] A Hepatitis A outbreak was reported by the United Nations on 3 
December.[93] The UN reported disease outbreaks in southern Gaza shelters.[94] 
Volker T√ºrk warned of unsanitary conditions amidst mass displacement in southern 
Gaza.[95] On 7 December, the World Health Organization reported increases in 
acute respiratory infections, scabies, jaundice, and diarrhea.[96] On 13 
December, 360,000 cases of infectious diseases were reported in shelters.[97] On 
20 December, WHO reported Gaza was experiencing "soaring rates of infectious 
disease outbreaks".[98] 

<p>On 29 December, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported 180,000 cases of 
upper respiratory infections, 136,400 cases of diarrhoea, 55,400 cases of lice 
and scabies, 5,330 cases of chickenpox, 42,700 cases of skin rash, and 4,722 
cases of impetigo.[99] Flooding in Gaza spread sewage water, raising fears of 
the spread of disease.[100][101] On 19 January, Yahya Al-Sarraj, the mayor of 
Gaza City, stated more than 50,000 tons of trash had accumulated in the city, 
further leading to the spread of disease.[102] Parents reported children falling 
sick after being exposed to raw sewage.[103] 

<p>In his address to the UN Security Council on 31 January 2024, Martin Griffiths, 
the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief 
coordination, provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges currently 
confronting numerous individuals in Gaza. According to our latest estimates, 
approximately 75 percent of the entire population has been displaced. The living 
conditions they endure are deplorable and deteriorating with each passing day. 
The makeshift tent camps, established by refugees and displaced people, are 
being inundated by heavy rains, compelling children, parents, and the elderly to 
seek shelter in the mud. The issue of food insecurity continues to escalate, 
while access to clean water remains almost entirely unattainable. Given the 
limited availability of public health support, preventable diseases are rampant 
and will persistently propagate.[104] On 4 March, the Gaza Health Ministry 
stated they had recorded about one million cases of infectious diseases.[105] 

<h3>Psychological health </h3>

<p>Weeks of continuous air strikes and explosions have contributed to the 
psychological destruction of children in Gaza. Following 16 days of bombardment, 
children developed severe trauma, with symptoms including convulsion, aggression, 
bed-wetting, and nervousness. 90% of children in pediatric hospitals in Gaza 
exhibited or reported symptoms of anxiety, the majority exhibited post-traumatic 
stress symptoms, and 82% reported fears of imminent death.[106] On 6 November, 
UNICEF spokesman Toby Fricker warned of the psychological impacts and "massive 
stress" experienced by children in Gaza.[107] On 17 November, WHO chief Tedros 
Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated 20,000 people were in need of specialized mental 
health services.[108] On 9 January, OCHA reported 485,000 people with mental 
health issues were experiencing care disruption.[109] 

<h3>Healthcare </h3>

<p>The healthcare system of Gaza faced several humanitarian crises as a result of 
the conflict. Due to Israel's siege, hospitals faced a lack of fuel and relied 
on backup generators for the first two weeks of the war.[110] By 23 October, 
Gaza hospitals began shutting down as they ran out of fuel, starting with the 
Indonesia Hospital.[111] When hospitals lost power completely, multiple 
premature babies in NICUs died.[112][113] Numerous medical staffers were killed 
by Israeli airstrikes, and ambulances, health institutions, medical headquarters, 
and multiple hospitals were destroyed.[114] The Medecins Sans Frontieres said 
scores of ambulances and medical facilities were damaged or destroyed.[115][116] 
By late-October, the Gaza Health Ministry stated the healthcare system had "totally 
collapsed".[117] 

<p>By 5 January 2024, the World Health Organization reported there had been 304 
attacks on healthcare facilities in Gaza since 7 October, with 606 deaths.[118] 
On 24 January, WHO stated seven out of 24 hospitals remained partially 
operational in Northern Gaza, and seven out of 12 in Southern Gaza.[119] On 26 
January, a senior OHCHR official stated, "I fear that many more civilians will 
die. The continued attacks on specially protected facilities, such as hospitals, 
will kill civilians".[120] The same day, a Doctors Without Borders coordinator 
stated, "There is no longer a healthcare system in Gaza."[121] A senior 
technical adviser with the International Rescue Committee stated, "There's 
nothing that could have prepared me for the horrors that I saw."[122] 

<h3>Supplies shortages </h3>

<p>Following the shutdown of the Gaza Strip power station on 11 October, it was 
reported that hospitals in Gaza would soon run out of available fuel to power 
generators.[123] The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital faced a dialysis crisis, with 
hundreds sharing only 24 dialysis machines.[79] WHO announced it could no longer 
resupply al-Shifa and al-Quds hospitals due to the high levels of risk.[124] On 
1 November, the director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital stated 
Gaza's only cancer hospital was "completely out of service" after it ran out of 
fuel to power its generator.[125] 

<p>On 2 November, the Indonesia Hospital announced its main generator was no longer 
operational.[126] On 3 November, the Health Ministry stated 12 cancer patients 
had died after the Turkish Hospital shut down.[127] On 4 November, the 
generators at Kamal Adwan Hospital shut down.[128] As of 5 November, nearly half 
of all hospitals were out of service due to shortages of fuel and power, and 
amputations and C-sections were performed without anesthetic due to shortages of 
supplies.[129] 

<p>On 8 November, Al-Quds completely ran out of fuel and shut down most services.[130] 
The Ministry of Health stated Israel cut off Indonesia Hospital's electricity, 
water, and communication.[131] On 13 November, Kamal Adwan Hospital ran out of 
fuel.[132] The al-Amal Hospital's only generator shut down.[133] 

<p>On 6 December, Doctors Without Borders stated fuel and medical supplies at al-Aqsa 
hospital were critically low.[134][135] Doctors at Nasser Medical Complex in 
Khan Younis described a lack of supplies and barely any medical functionality.[136] 

<p>From 11 October 2023 onwards, the Gaza Strip has experienced a complete lack of 
electricity due to the Israeli authorities discontinuing the power supply and 
depleting the fuel reserves for Gaza's only power plant. The United Nations has 
observed that this ongoing blackout, along with the shutdown of communications 
and industrial fuel, is greatly impeding the aid community's ability to assess 
and effectively address the worsening humanitarian crisis;[137] 

<h3>Attacks and destruction </h3>

<p>Doctors Without Borders Twitter @MSF_canada 

<p>"We're on the fourth floor, there's a sniper who attacked four patients inside 
the hospital. One of them has a gunshot wound directly in his neck, and he is a 
quadriplegic [patient], and the other one [was shot] in the abdomen." 

<h4>November 11, 2023[138] </h4>

<p>On 14 October, the Diagnostic Cancer Treatment Centre of the Al-Ahli Arab 
Hospital was partially destroyed by Israeli rocket fire.[139] In a statement on 
15 October, the World Health Organization stated four hospitals were no longer 
functioning after being targeted by Israeli airstrikes.[140] On 17 October, a 
widely condemned explosion in the al-Ahli courtyard resulted in significant 
fatalities.[141] 

<p>On 30 October, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital was severely damaged 
by an Israeli airstrike.[142] The Gaza Health Ministry stated the maternity ward 
at the Al-Helou International Hospital was hit by an Israeli bombardment.[143] 

<p>Al-Quds and Indonesia Hospital were both also hit by strikes.[144] The entrance 
of the al-Nasser Children's Hospital was hit by an Israeli strike.[145] On 9 
November, the Gaza government media office stated Israel had bombed eight 
hospitals in the past three days.[146][147] 

<p>Israeli tanks surrounded four hospitals, al-Rantisi Hospital, al-Nasr Hospital, 
and the eye and mental health hospitals, from all directions.[148] The Nasser 
Rantissi paediatric cancer hospital caught on fire after being hit by an Israeli 
airstrike and began evacuations.[149][150] At least three hospitals were hit by 
Israeli airstrikes, leading the director of the Al-Shifa hospital to state, "Israel 
is now launching a war on Gaza City hospitals."[151] The strikes resulted in 
multiple casualties.[152] The Palestinian Red Crescent claimed Israeli snipers 
opened fire on children at al-Quds hospital, killing one and wounding 28.[153][154][155] 

<p>On 20 November, Israel launched an offensive on Indonesia Hospital with an 
airstrike that reportedly killed 12 people.[156] Following the strike, Israeli 
tanks surrounded the hospital.[157][158] Staff at the hospital reported Israeli 
soldiers shooting inside the hospital indiscriminately.[159][160][b] Four 
doctors were reported killed after Israel bombed al-Awda Hospital on 22 November.[165] 
The Kamal Adwan hospital stated Israeli bombings increased around the hospital.[166] 
Two Red Crescent paramedics were wounded by gunfire from the Israeli military.[167] 

<p>On 25 November, the director general of the Ministry of Health stated the 
Israeli military shot at medical teams during the temporary ceasefire in effect.[168] 
Doctors Without Borders stated al-Awda hospital had been damaged in an Israeli 
bombing.[169] On 9 December, WHO stated two health staff had been shot and 
killed by the IDF at Al Awda Hospital, besieged since 5 December.[170] The 
director of the European Hospital stated its paramedics had been wounded in 
Israeli airstrikes.[171] On 11 December, MSF stated one of its doctors inside Al 
Awda Hospital had been injured by an Israeli sniper.[172] 

<p>By 18 January 2024, none of Gaza's hospitals remained fully operational.[173] On 
19 January 2024, the Jordanian government reported that the Israeli military had 
deliberately targeted its new field hospital in Khan Younis, using a tank to 
block the hospital entrance and shooting at the hospital and bunker shelters.[174] 
On 24 January, the World Health Organization stated it had recorded a total of 
660 Israeli attacks on healthcare facilities.[175] 

<p>According to United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, the hostilities 
in Gaza and Israel have "created appalling human suffering, physical destruction 
and collective trauma across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory".[137] 

<h4>Al-Shifa Hospital </h4>

<p>In early November, Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza experienced a surge in Israeli 
attacks, with the facility being bombed five times in 24 hours.[176][177] An 
Israeli drone missile destroyed a medical convoy in front of the hospital,[178] 
and on November 6, Israel targeted the hospital's solar panels.[179] Doctors 
Without Borders reported a dramatic intensification of Israeli attacks on 
November 11, leading to power loss, sniper killings of staff, and the hospital 
being shelled and catching fire.[180][181] Families attempting to leave the 
complex were reportedly shot and killed.[182][c] 

<p>Physicians for Human Rights documented the deaths of two premature babies at Al-Shifa 
due to electricity shortages.[184] IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari pledged 
assistance in evacuating babies, but the Gaza Health Ministry asserted a lack of 
provided mechanisms.[185][186] On November 12, the hospital's director-general 
stated that 650 patients at Al-Shifa were in danger due to the catastrophic 
situation, including the destruction of the cardiac ward.[187][188] 

<p>Doctors Without Borders reported dire conditions at Al-Shifa Hospital, citing a 
lack of essentials like food, water, and electricity, with reports of a sniper 
targeting patients.[189] Israel's raid on the hospital on 15 November was 
described as an unimaginable nightmare.[d] Witnesses stated that Israel did not 
provide aid or supplies.[192][193] The hospital faced challenges, including 
decomposing bodies and maggot-infested wounds, due to a lack of essential 
resources.[194][195] 

<p>Amid deteriorating conditions, an evacuation of Al-Shifa began on November 18.[e][197] 
Ismail al-Thawabta, a Palestinian media office spokesperson, asserted that 
patients moved to other facilities faced a perilous fate.[198] ActionAid 
characterized the evacuation as a death sentence.[199] Concerns were raised 
about the adequacy of aid. The World Health Organization and the Palestinian Red 
Crescent participated in evacuation plans, aiming to transfer patients to 
alternative medical facilities. 

<p>The hospital stated six doctors would remain behind with 120 patients too sick 
to be transferred.[200] A humanitarian team from the World Health Organization 
visited al-Shifa and found a lack of food, water, or medicine, with signs of 
gunfire and a mass grave.[201] The director of al-Shifa said people were only 
given one hour to evacuate, stating, "we were forced to leave at gunpoint."[202][203] 
WHO stated 25 health workers and 291 patients, including 32 babies remained at 
al-Shifa.[204] 

<p>On 19 November, the premature babies at al-Shifa were evacuated to southern Gaza, 
where they were planned to be moved to Egypt the following day.[205] The World 
Health Organization stated it was planning missions to transport the remaining 
al-Shifa patients to Nasser Medical Complex and European Gaza Hospital in the 
next 2-3 days.[206] 

<p>Staff at Al-Shifa stated 50 patients, including infants, had died due to power 
and oxygen shortages.[207] The director of Al-Shifa stated Israel's claim to 
provide incubators to premature babies was false.[208] On 22 November, the 
Palestinian Red Crescent stated fourteen ambulances had arrived at al-Shifa to 
evacuate the hospital's remaining patients.[209] 

<p>On 26 November, the conditions for remaining patients at al-Shifa were 
reportedly dire.[210] On 27 November, the Ministry of Health reported a 
volunteer effort at al-Shifa hospital sought to restart the dialysis department.[211] 
By 28 November, the dialysis unit was reportedly reopened and receiving patients.[212][213] 
On 7 December, the Gaza Health Ministry stated only basic first aid was being 
delivered at Al-Shifa Hospital.[214] 

<h4>Kamal Adwan Hospital </h4>

<p>On 3 December, the IDF bombed the Kamal Adwan hospital, killing at least four 
people.[215] Attacks in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan hospital were reported on 5 
December.[216] The director of Kamal Adwan Hospital stated Israel had killed two 
mothers and their newborn babies when Israel targeted its maternity ward.[217] 
The UN confirmed the killings.[218] Israel raided the Kamal Adwan Hospital.[219][220] 
In response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated WHO was extremely worried for 
Kamal Adwan's medical staff.[221] 

<h4>Al-Aqsa Hospital </h4>

<p>Beginning on 6 January, doctors at Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital reported that 
Israeli fire was nearing the hospital. Tens of thousands of people were reported 
to be sheltering at the hospital.[222] British doctor Nick Maynard stated his 
medical team was forced to evacuate the hospital as Israeli troops attacked the 
hospital.[223] Medical Aid for Palestinians and the International Rescue 
Committee both also evacuated their medical teams when the IDF dropped leaflets 
telling nearby residents they were in a "dangerous combat zone."[224][225] 
Following a visit to the hospital, the World Health Organization found 70% of 
staff and many patients had fled.[226] Doctors reported many patients who were 
physically unable to move, and that conditions were rapidly deteriorating, with 
one doctor stating, "A child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their 
hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and 
talking. And we had no morphine."[225][227] 

<p>In an interview with NPR on 10 January, one American doctor described the 
situation at Al-Aqsa as the "stuff of nightmares".[228] Tedros Adhanom 
Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization chief, stated, "Three months into 
this conflict, it is inconceivable that this most essential need ‚Äî the 
protection of health care ‚Äî is not assured."[229] Health professionals and 
doctors warned of the danger of Al-Aqsa's closure since it was the last 
remaining hospital in the entirety of central Gaza.[230] On 13 January, the 
hospital ran out of fuel to power its generators, leading to a blackout that 
threatened patients.[231] 

<h4>Evacuation challenges </h4>

<p>On 14 October, Israel ordered the evacuation of 22 hospitals in northern Gaza. 
The WHO described the order as a "death sentence" for the sick and wounded.[232] 
Doctors across northern Gaza stated they were unable to follow Israel's 
evacuation order, since their patients, including newborns in the ICU, would die.[233] 
Doctors at al-Quds Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent reported they 
received a call from the Israeli army to evacuate the hospital or "bear the 
consequences".[234][235] 

<p>On 29 October, the Palestinian Red Crescent reported that it had received 
warnings from Israeli authorities to immediately evacuate al-Quds hospital as it 
was "going to be bombarded".[236] That day, an Israeli airstrike struck 20 
metres (65 feet) from the hospital.[237] Mai al-Kaila, the Palestinian Minister 
of Health, stated the Israeli army was not evacuating patients, but rather "forcibly 
evicting the wounded and patients onto the streets, leaving them to face 
inevitable death."[238] The director of the Nasr Hospital stated it had been 
evacuated under threat of Israeli weapons and tanks.[239] Fighting near Al-Quds 
Hospital halted evacuation efforts.[240] 

<p>On 21 November, the World Health Organization stated three hospitals in northern

<p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Twitter @DrTedros 

<p>Patients were receiving care on the floor, screaming in pain. These conditions 
are beyond inadequate - unimaginable for the provision of health care. I cannot 
find words strong enough to express our concern over what we're witnessing. 

<h4>December 2, 2023[254] </h4>

<p>The Red Cross stated Gaza's entire health system was "on its knees".[255] 
Medical Aid for Palestinians and UNICEF issued an "urgent warning" that 130 
premature babies would die if fuel did not reach Gaza hospitals soon.[256][257]

ship, named Vulcano ("Volcano"),[261] initially had 170 staff members on board, 
30 of whom trained for medical emergencies;[260][261] 28 more members between 
physicians, nurses and biologists were set to join the expedition in a later 
phase.[261][g] By early-December, the medical staff started performing emergency 
surgical operations for injured Palestinian patients who were either at risk of 
amputation, or waiting to be moved to the Children Hospital in Doha.[262] On 5 
February 2024, it was announced that the Vulcano had returned to Italy and 
arrived at the seaport of La Spezia, carrying 60 Palestinian people,[263][264] 
14 of which were children in need of specialized healthcare, although none of 
them suffered from life-threatening conditions or injuries.[264] All of the 
children were set to be transferred to various hospitals in Genoa, Rome, 
Florence, Bologna and Milan.[263][264] 

<p>On 9 November, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca announced Turkey was prepared to

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described as "almost impossible in the current 
circumstances."[273][274] On 12 December, WHO pleaded with the Israeli army not 
to destroy hospitals in southern Gaza.[275] Doctors Without Borders said 
healthcare conditions in Gaza were akin to conditions during World War I.[276] 

<h3>Additional challenges </h3>

<p>On 28 October, a communications blackout meant wounded civilians could not dial 
emergency services.[277] Ambulances were then evenly geographically distributed

<p>On 9 January, Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for Israel and Palestine, 
stated, "I've never seen so many amputees in my life, including among children. 
This will have such a long-term impact for everything."[289] On 18 January, the 
United Nations reported patients were dying even while hospitalized because Gaza's 
remaining hospitals were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of wounded people.[290] 

<h3>Airstrikes </h3>

<p>October

<p>In just one week, Israel dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza.[291] Israel's 
airstrikes were described as a carpet bombing and "indiscriminate".[292][293] By

On 19 October, an Israeli airstrike hit the Church of Saint Porphyrius, where 
500 people were sheltering.[303] Israel "pounded" areas in south Gaza it had 
declared as "safe zones", raising fears amongst residents that nowhere was safe.[18] 
On 19 October, U.S. officials reported alarm at Israeli comments about the "inevitability 
of civilian casualties", after it used the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki as historical comparisons for their Gaza campaign.[304] 

<p>On 20 October, Israeli continued to bombard south Gaza.[305] IDF spokesman Nir 
Dinar said, "There are no safe zones".[306] On 21 October, Israel intensified 
its airstrikes in advance of an expected ground invasion.[307][308] On 22 
October, Israeli airplanes bombed the areas around the Al Shifa and Al Quds 
hospitals on a night described as the "bloodiest" of the conflict so far.[309][310]

rubble, 136 paramedics had been killed, and 25 ambulance vehicles had been 
destroyed.[319] On the same day, Israel bombed a medical convoy outside of al-Shifa 
hospital.[320] The IDF claimed the ambulance was being used by Hamas, leading 
Queen's University professor Ardi Imseis to state Israel needed to prove its 
claim.[321] The IDF also bombed the Osama Ben Zaid school.[322][323] On 4

On 12 November, Israel used earthquake bombs on an apartment complex in Khan 
Younis, killing at least thirteen people.[329] On 13 November, an Israeli 
airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp killed thirty people, with Gaza's civil 
defence team unable to rescue injured people from the rubble due to a lack of 
equipment.[330] 

<p>According to sources, both Israeli and Western, Hamas placed military facilities 
under schools, hospitals and mosques throughout Gaza (including Al-Shifa and the 
Indonesia Hospital), or used them as cover for its fighters.[331] According to 
The Guardian, there were indications of Hamas' use of hospitals, schools and 
residential building as early as 2014.[332][h] These claims have been disputed, 
however, including by organizations like Human Rights Watch, UNRWA, and the 
Palestinian Red Crescent.[334] The Government of Qatar has criticized the lack 
of either concrete evidence or independent investigations, and both Palestinian 
and international medical staff have disputed them.[335] Michael Lynk stated 
Israel's claims were used to prepare "public opinion for the attacks to come".[336] 

<p>On 15 November, Gaza's last remaining flour mill was hit by an Israeli airstrike.[337] 
On 17 November, dozens were reported killed after an airstrike on al-Falah 
School in the Zeitoun neighborhood, south of Gaza City.[338] The following day, 
26 people were killed in an airstrike of a residential building in southern Gaza.[339]

blind, and intellectually handicapped individuals were at particular risk of 
death by airstrikes.[341] Following Israel's evacuation orders for Palestinians 
to flee northern Gaza, the IDF intensified its attacks on southern Gaza.[342] It

it had struck at least 400 locations in Gaza since the pause had ended, 
including 50 in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.[346] On 3 December, the 
Palestinian Civil Defence stated the situation "beyond dire" as the organization 
was unable to rescue many people buried under rubble.[347] The same day, 700 
were reported killed in the preceding twenty-four hours.[348] Some individuals 
were rescued by aid workers after reportedly surviving several days buried 
underneath rubble.[349] Robert Pape stated, "Gaza will also go down as a place 
name denoting one of history's heaviest conventional bombing campaigns."[350] On 
8 December, 350 people were reportedly killed in the preceding twenty-four hours.[351] 
On 9 December, the Palestinian Civil Defence stated it only had one operational 
rescue vehicle left in the entirety of northern Gaza.[352] On 13 December, a 
UNRWA school in Beit Hanoun was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.[353] On 14 
December, a US intelligence report found half of the bombs dropped on Gaza had 
been unguided bombs.[354] 

<p>A Sky News analysis found Israel was directly targeting areas that it was 
telling people to flee to.[355] Experts stated the bombing campaign against Gaza 
had been the deadliest and most destructive in modern history, with Corey Scher 
of the CUNY Graduate Center stating, "Gaza is now a different color from space."[356] 
The Wall Street Journal described the Israeli bombing in Gaza as the "most 
devastating urban warfare in the modern record".[357] Torrential rains caused 
flooding, which raised fears of disease spread.[358] 

<p>January 

<p>On 5 January 2024, evacuees fleeing Israeli attacks in central Gaza stated the 
situation there was "hell on Earth."[359] One survivor of an Israeli airstrike 
wrote, "Even though that air strike did not kill us, it destroyed something 
inside us."[360] On 12 January, the UN Secretary-General for Human Rights stated 
that at least 319 internally displaced persons were killed and 1,135 injured by 
Israeli airstrikes while sheltering in UN shelters.[361] 

<p>As of January 2024, Israel's offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70-80% of 
all buildings in northern Gaza.[362][363] Numerous casualties were reported in 
an airstrike on a residential building near Nasser Medical Complex in Khan 
Younis, with hospital staff reporting having to bury 40 bodies on the hospital 
grounds.[364] By 30 January, at least half of all buildings in the entirety of 
Gaza had been destroyed or damaged.[365] 

<p>February 

<p>On 2 February 2024, UNOSAT, the UN's satellite centre, found that 69,147 
structures, or approximately 30 percent of Gaza's total buildings, had been 
damaged or destroyed by Israeli airstrikes, shelling, and demolitions.[366] The 
New York Times estimated that at least half of Gaza's buildings had been damaged 
or destroyed.[367] Israeli bombing campaigns intensified in central Gaza, as 
displaced people in Rafah grew fearful of an impending Israeli attack on the 
city.[368][369] 

<h3>Displacement </h3>

<p>On 10 October, the United Nations said the fighting had displaced more than 423,000 
Palestinians,[370] while Israeli airstrikes had destroyed 1,000 homes and 
rendered 560 housing units uninhabitable.[40] By 15 October, an estimated 1 
million people in Gaza had been displaced, many of them fleeing northern Gaza 
following Israel's mandated evacuation.[371][372] Due to continued heavy Israeli 
bombing in south Gaza, some northern Gazan refugees moved back to Gaza City.[373][374] 
On 19 October, the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs stated 98,000 houses, or 1 
in every 4 homes in Gaza, had been destroyed by Israeli bombardments.[375] On 21 
October, the UNRWA stated 500,000 people were sheltering in UN facilities, and 
conditions had grown "untenable".[376] By the end of October this had grown to 
over 670,000 people.[377] Many others sheltered in hospitals.[378] 

<p>By 22 October, the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs stated 42% of homes in 
Gaza had been destroyed.[379] By 23 October, an estimated 1.4 million people in 
Gaza had been left homeless.[380] On 30 October, the Red Cross stated it would 
take years to rebuild destroyed homes and infrastructure.[381] On 2 November, 
UNRWA stated 50 of its buildings and assets had been affected by Israeli strikes, 
including four shelters.[382] On 6 November, Al Jazeera journalist Hani Mahmoud 
described southern Gaza as a large concentration camp.[383] As the fighting in 
Gaza City intensified, the IDF announced a daily four-hour window for residents 
to move south, leading to thousands fleeing the city.[384] On 10 November, an 
Israeli spokesman stated 100,000 people had fled northern Gaza in the prior two 
days.[385] On 11 November, UNICEF stated thousands of children in northern Gaza 
were "hanging on by a thread."[386] 

<p>On 12 November, CARE International stated, "The journey to the south is 
incredibly dangerous and hard. Many of those who have made it out have 
experienced and witnessed terrible suffering."[387] On 14 November, Human Rights 
Watch stated, "There is no reliably safe route to evacuate. Satellite imagery 
confirms fires, military operations, and roadblocks on every conceivable route."[388] 
By 20 November, satellite imagery showed half of northern Gaza had been 
destroyed by Israeli airstrikes.[389] The Financial Times described northern 
Gaza as a "bombed-out wasteland."[390] Palestinians feared northern Gaza was 
becoming uninhabitable.[391] By 28 November, the UN estimated 60 percent of all 
housing in Gaza had been destroyed.[392] The Financial Times estimated it would 
cost billions to rebuild Gaza.[393][i] 

<p>On 1 December, Israel labelled Khan Younis a "dangerous combat zone."[395] It 
issued a map of numbered zones, dividing the Gaza Strip into hundreds of 
different districts.[396] It also issued an evacuation order in southern Gaza 
for residents to move to Rafah.[397] At the same time it issued the evacuation, 
Israel bombed Rafah.[398] On 4 December, a UN representative stated "another 
wave of displacement is underway."[399] The UN stated at least four of its 
shelters in Khan Younis had received evacuation orders from the Israeli military.[400] 
By 13 December, half of Gaza's population was in Rafah.[401] On 21 December, a 
Financial Times analysis found Israel had left northern Gaza virtually 
uninhabitable.[402] On 6 January 2024, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths 
stated that Gaza had "simply become uninhabitable".[403] More than 85% of 
Palestinians in Gaza, or around 1.9 million people, were internally displaced.[404] 

<p>On 8 January, Al Jazeera reported Palestinians in Gaza were using websites like 
GoFundMe to fundraise the necessary money to enter Egypt via the Rafah Crossing.[405] 
UNOCHA reported there were as many 15 people living per tent.[109] On 13 January, 
the Gaza Health Ministry reported the infrastructure of Rafah was at its 
breaking point, unable to handle the large number of displaced people who'd fled 
there.[406] Philippe Lazzarini stated on 17 January, "You have hundreds of 
thousands of people living now in the street, living in these plastic makeshift 
tents, sleeping on the concrete."[407] On 24 January, Israel ordered a large 
area of Khan Younis to evacuate, affecting three hospitals, 24 United Nations 
shelters, and more than 500,000 people.[408] In February 2024, Gaza's 
information office stated the IDF was deliberately burning homes.[409] 

<h3>Communications </h3>

<p>On 27 October, Gaza underwent a near total communications blackout after Paltel's 
communication towers were destroyed in an Israeli attack.[410] This cut off Gaza 
from any phone or internet service.[411] As a result, humanitarian groups, 
including UNICEF, WHO, the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Doctors Without 
Borders, American Friends Service Committee, Medical Aid for Palestinians, and 
ActionAid lost all contact with their staff.[412] The Palestinian Red Crescent 
Society stated wounded people would no longer be able to dial Gaza's emergency 
number for an ambulance.[413] The Red Crescent stated it was "deeply concerned" 
about the ability of medics to provide care, stating it had lost all contact 
with operations room and staff in Gaza.[413] On 28 October, Elon Musk offered to 
provide humanitarian groups with Starlink access, but Shlomo Karhi stated Israel 
would fight it with every "means at its disposal" because Hamas will use it for 
terrorist activities.[414][415] 

<p>The UN Assistant Secretary-General and Humanitarian Coordinator in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, Lynn Hastings,[416] stated that hospitals and aid 
operations could not operate without phone lines or internet.[417] The Committee 
to Protect Journalists warned the world was "losing a window into the reality" 
of the situation in Gaza.[418] Michael Lynk, a former UN rapporteur, stated one 
purpose of the internet blackout was to keep "the world blinded on what's 
happening."[419] The WHO secretary-general Tedros Ghebreyesus stated he was "gravely 
concerned" by the blackout for the "immediate health risks" it posed to patients 
and for the safety of WHO staff.[412][420] In a post on X, ActionAid wrote the 
blackout would make it "nearly impossible" for people to seek help, and stated 
they were "gravely concerned" for "all the people of Gaza."[421] 

<p>Marwa Fatafta, policy manager of Access Now, stated that "taking Gaza completely 
off the grid while launching an unprecedented bombardment campaign only means 
something atrocious is about to happen."[410] On 28 October, Netblocks stated 
Gaza's telephone and internet communications were gradually returning.[422] On 
31 October, Fatafta stated the blackout had been used by Israel to cover up 
potential war crimes as they began their ground invasion and called it a "warfare 
tactic to induce more pain on the population."[423] Paltel announced Gaza had 
again been cut off from telecommunications and internet service.[423] On 5 
November, internet and telecoms were cut for a third time.[424] Some residents 
used eSIMs to stay connected to mobile networks.[425] On 16 November, 
communications in Gaza were cut off for a fourth time.[426] The following day, 
communications were restored after a limited quantity of fuel was allowed to 
enter the Gaza Strip.[427] On 27 November, Shlomo Karhi stated Musk had agreed 
not to operate Starlink in Gaza without Israeli approval.[428] On 3 December, 
PalTel reported another communications blackout.[429] On 14 December, Gaza's 
communication companies reported the sixth communications blackout since the 
conflict's start.[430] 

<p>On 20 December, Paltel, Ooredoo, and Jawwal reported a communications blackout 
in the Gaza Strip.[431] Wounded people unable to call ambulances due to the 
blackouts reported biking and taking donkey carts to hospitals, while ambulance 
drivers stated they simply followed plumes of smoke or the sound of explosions.[432] 
Telecoms went down on 26 December.[433] On 12 January, the ninth communications 
blackout occurred, cutting off phone and internet access across the Strip.[434] 
The following day, Jawwal reported an Israeli drone strike had killed two of 
their engineers attempting to repair the system, noting they had lost a total of 
13 employees so far.[435] The communications blackout was the longest of the war.[436][j] 
The tenth blackout occurred on 22 January.[438] In a statement, UNWRA stated, "Disruption 
of telecommunication services prevents people in Gaza from accessing life-saving 
information or calling for first responders, and continues to impede 
humanitarian response."[439] The Ministry of Communications stated on 27 January 
that Israel had fired live bullets and a tank shell at its telecommunications 
crews.[440] NetBlocks reported a "high impact" outage on 5 March.[441] 

<h3>Humanitarian aid </h3>

<h4>Initial block on aid </h4>

<p>The amount of aid coming in is a drop in the bucket of Gaza's humanitarian needs. 
Before this conflict, about 100 trucks of aid alone entered Gaza [a day]. So 
imagine now, with all the hostilities going on, if only this number is coming in. 

<p>On 9 October, Israel implemented a complete blockade on Gaza, preventing the 
entry of any humanitarian aid.[443] Egypt closed its border to prevent civilians 
fleeing, but said that it would allow aid to be delivered through the Rafah 
crossing.[444] A week later, despite international calls for deliveries, 
hundreds of tons of aid were stuck on Egypt's side of the border, as Israel 
bombarded the crossing amid fears of weapons deliveries, and declined to assure 
Egyptian authorities it would pause airstrikes for civilian aid convoys.[445][446] 
In Israel, aid to Gaza was reportedly prevented by far-right politicians allied 
with Netanyahu.[447] On 17 October, the UNRWA stated that there was currently "no 
water or electricity in Gaza. Soon there will be no food or medicine either".[448][449] 

<h4>Deliveries to southern Gaza </h4>

<p>On 18 October, Israel announced it would allow food, water, and medicine to be 
delivered to a "safe zone" in west Khan Younis in southern Gaza, distributed by 
the United Nations.[450][50][451] Later the same day, US president Joe Biden 
announced Egypt agreed to allow 20 trucks with aid to enter Gaza by 20 October.[452][453] 
More than 100 trucks of aid were waiting at the Rafah crossing to enter into 
Gaza.[454] In a statement, Human Rights Watch stated that without electricity or 
fuel, however, the provided aid would fail "meeting the needs of Gaza's 
population".[455][450] On 19 October, US Special Envoy David M. Satterfield 
stated the US wanted "sustained" aid into Gaza.[456] The same day, a spokesman 
for Oxfam stated aid distribution in Gaza would be a "big challenge", and the UN 
reported at least 100 trucks a day of aid were needed.[457][458] On 21 October 
20 trucks of aid entered Gaza.[459] Ant√≥nio Guterres stated it was not enough to 
prevent an "humanitarian catastrophe".[460] Martin Griffiths said the UN was 
working to develop an "at-scale operation".[461] On 22 October, following the 
second delivery of trucks, Biden and Netanyahu stated aid would continue to be 
allowed into Gaza.[462] 

<h4>Issues with delivery </h4>

<p>On 27 October, Lynn Hastings, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Palestine, 
stated Israel opposed the delivery of humanitarian aid to northern Gaza.[463] As 
a result, UN staff would need to risk their own lives if it was determined such 
aid would be "lifesaving" to people in need.[463] Philippe Lazzarini stated "soon 
many more will die" from Israel's blockade.[464] 

<p>When asked about Hamas's responsibility for the safety of civilians, Hamas 
leader Mousa Abu Marzook allegedly replied that "it is the responsibility of the 
United Nations to protect them... [and] it is the responsibility of the 
occupation to provide them with... services".[465][466] On 28 October, The New 
York Times reported that Hamas had stockpiled food, water, medicine and sanitary 
products in underground caches, in amounts that would allow it to continue 
fighting for several months without resupply.[467] On 12 November, Kan 11 aired 
a video taken by a Gazan civilian, that appeared to show Hamas policemen beating 
civilians approaching a truck carrying humanitarian aid for food, before 
allegedly taking the supplies for themselves.[468] 

<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry stated "Israeli obstacles" were impeding 
the delivery of humanitarian aid.[469] The United Nations announced the 
communications blackout had brought aid delivery to a "complete halt."[470] On 
29 October, a humanitarian zone was announced in the Khan Younis area, along 
with a claim that aid trucks would increase "significantly."[471] On 30 October, 
OCHA director Lisa Doughten pressured the UN Security Council for the use of 
extra entry points to Gaza, suggesting the Kerem Shalom border crossing as the 
only entry equipped for rapidly processing a sufficiently large number of trucks.[472][473] 
On 13 November, the United Nations announced it no longer had enough fuel to 
deliver humanitarian aid in Gaza, leading Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly 
to say, "This is not acceptable."[474] On 17 November, the UN suspended aid 
delivery again due to the shortage of fuel and the cutoff of communications.[475] 

<h4>Delivery during temporary ceasefire </h4>

<p>The amount of aid entering Gaza increased during the temporary November 
ceasefire.[476] On 26 November, the largest shipment of humanitarian aid reached 
northern Gaza since the start of the conflict nearly two months before.[477] 
Philippe Lazzarini stated the aid entering Gaza was still inadequate.[478] Samer 
AbdelJaber, a World Food Programme head, stated people were hungry and desperate.[479] 
On 28 November, the White House reported that over 2,000 trucks of aid had 
entered Gaza since 21 October.[480] 

<h3>Resumption of hostilities </h3>

<p>Following the resumption of hostilities on 1 December, aid deliveries into Gaza 
ceased.[481] The IDF informed the Palestinian Red Crescent that the entry of 
trucks was "prohibited, starting from today" until further notice.[482] Later 
the same day, the United States announced they had requested a reversal of the 
decision, and Israel stated it was prepared to allow aid at pre-pause levels.[483] 
On 4 December, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) stated that approximately 100 humanitarian aid trucks and 69,000 
litres of fuel entered Gaza on 3 December and 4 December. This was "well below" 
the on average 170 trucks and 110,000 litres of fuel that were delivered daily 
during the temporary ceasefire.[484] On 4 December, Lynn Hastings, a UN 
humanitarian coordinator, stated, "The conditions required to deliver aid to the 
people of Gaza do not exist" and warned of a "hellish scenario" in which aid 
delivery was entirely impossible.[485][k] Josep Borrell shared a warning on 
social media from Martin Griffiths stating an immediate ceasefire was needed for 
the UN to continue humanitarian operations.[487] WHO stated Israel shot at its 
humanitarian relief trucks in Gaza City.[488] 

<p>On 15 December, Israel approved reopening of the Kerem Shalom crossing and 
announced that the US would be paying to upgrade the Rafah crossing.[489] 
Following a tour of the Rafah crossing, MEP Barry Andrews stated he believed 
Israel was deliberately delaying aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip.[490] On 19 
December, UNRWA headquarters was bombed.[491] UN chief Antonio Guterres stated 
the way Israel was conducting its offensive was creating obstacles for delivery.[492] 
On 29 December, Israel fired on a humanitarian aid truck marked with U.N. 
insignia.[493] Israel announced on 31 December it was prepared to allow aid 
ships from Cyprus to enter Gaza.[494] France and Jordan airdropped aid on 5 
January.[495] On 11 January, Samer AbdelJaber, a World Food Programme director, 
stated the organization had delivered "crucial food assistance to thousands of 
people facing catastrophic hunger" in Gaza City for the first time in weeks.[496] 

<p>On 13 January 2024, UNOCHA reported the amount of aid Israel was allowing into 
Israel had significantly deceased since the prior month.[497] Omar Shakir, Human 
Rights Watch's Israel-Palestine director, stated, "This is a deliberate Israeli 
government policy. Aid is not reaching north Gaza."[498] U.S. senators Chris Van 
Hollen and Jeff Merkley criticized Israel's inspection of humanitarian aid as "arbitrary" 
and "broken".[499] A joint statement by the heads of UNICEF, WHO, and the World 
Food Programme stated the limited quantity of aid arriving in Gaza was unable to 
prevent the "deadly combination of hunger, malnutrition, and disease".[500] A 
viral video showed huge crowds of hungry people rushing toward a rumored relief 
truck.[501] On 16 January, a deal was reached between Israel and Hamas to bring 
more aid into Gaza.[502] On 19 January, UNOCHA reported that nearly 70% of its 
aid deliveries to northern Gaza had been denied by Israel.[503] On 29 January, 
the United Nations reported that Israel had denied 29 aid missions to northern 
Gaza.[504] 

<p>In late-January, at least 15 countries announced they were suspending funding 
for UNRWA.[505] Philippe Lazarrini, the agency chief, stated, "Our humanitarian 
operation, on which 2 million people depend as a lifeline in Gaza, is collapsing."[506] 
The regional director of Doctors Without Borders stated, "If you stop these 
trucks, people will die of hunger and very quickly".[507] UNRWA warned that 
without continued funding, it would be forced to cease operations by the end of 
February 2024.[508] 

<h3>Killing of aid workers </h3>

<p>From 7 October to 17 December, 135 United Nations relief workers were killed by 
the Israeli Military in the Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest conflict for UN 
workers in world history.[509][510] According to Jeremy Konyndyk, the president 
of Refugees International, "The U.S. concern about these casualties remains 
almost purely rhetorical. There is no policy leverage being put behind it 
whatsoever. Beyond expressing concern and expressing regret, that's where it 
stops."[511] On 24 February 2024, the U.S. asked Israel to cease killing police 
in Gaza, stating it was exacerbating the crisis and leading to a "total 
breakdown of law and order".[512] 

<h3>Impact on children </h3>

<h4>Breakdown of deaths by age and gender (analysis by professors Michael Spagat and 
Daniel Silverman), November 2023[513] </h4>

<p>Men and boys over 14 (35.3%)

<p>Women and girls over 14 (24.1%)

<p>Children under 14 (33.8%)

<p>Elderly, above 60 (6.8%) 

<p>Due to over 40% of Gaza's population being 14 or under, children have been 
notably impacted by Israel's attack.[514] On 13 November, UNICEF stated more 
than 700,000 children in Gaza were displaced.[515] The Palestine Red Crescent 
Society stated displaced children were suffering, due to power outages, lack of 
basic essentials, and "scenes of pain and fear."[516] Catherine M. Russell, the 
executive director of UNICEF, toured Gaza on 15 November, stating many children 
were buried under rubble and lacking medical care.[517] Dr. Ahmed al-Fara, the 
head of pediatrics at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, stated due to the 
lack of clean water, he was witnessing the "most serious epidemic of 
gastroenteritis" among children he had ever seen.[518] UNICEF spokesperson Toby 
Fricker stated, "There is no safe place for children anywhere across the strip 
right now."[519] Save the Children reported serious signs of mental health 
issues among children in Gaza.[520] 

<p>On 22 November, UNICEF reported unaccompanied children had been identified 
evacuating from northern to southern Gaza by themselves.[521] On 28 November, 
James Elder, a UNICEF spokesperson, stated wounded children were sheltering 
outdoors in car parks and gardens.[522] Elder called the conflict in Gaza a "war 
on children."[523] Doctors warned children who survived Israeli airstrikes were 
left with permanent disabilities and trauma.[524] Aid workers coined the term 
WCNSF, meaning Wounded Child No Surviving Family.[524] The bodies of some 
children buried under rubble remained unrecovered.[525] By 3 December, an 
estimated 6,150 children had been killed in the conflict.[526] In mid-December, 
the Ministry of Health stated it had run out of vaccinations for children, which 
would have catastrophic repercussions.[527] The Euro-Med Monitor estimated at 
least 25,000 children had lost one or both parents.[528] On 19 December, the 
United Nations stated Gaza was "by far the most dangerous place in the world to 
be a child".[529] More children were killed in Gaza in two and a half months 
than the total of children killed in all conflicts around the world in the 
previous three years combined.[530] 

<p>On 21 December, UNICEF reported thousands of children had undergone limb 
amputations.[531] Save the Children reported 10 children a day in Gaza had lost 
their limbs, which would result in a lifetime of medical needs.[532] On 28 
December, UNOCHA stated 50 percent of all children in the Gaza Strip were 
experiencing dehydration, malnutrition, respiratory and skin diseases.[533] An 
UNOCHA representative stated the organization was having difficulty delivering 
childhood vaccines.[534] On 3 January 2024, UNICEF chief Catherine M. Russell 
stated many children in Gaza were facing severe acute malnutrition.[535] On 5 
January, UNICEF found 90 percent of children under the age of two were eating 
two or fewer food groups a day.[536] 

<p>On 6 January 2024, Tanya Haj-Hassan, a doctor with Doctors Without Borders, 
stated children in Gaza were "dying in every way possible."[537] In some cases, 
newborns were rescued from under rubble after surviving bombings.[538] A report 
by Save the Children on 12 January stated children were "enduring unspeakable 
horrors, including life-changing injuries, burns, disease, inadequate medical 
care, and losing their parents and other loved ones".[539] On 16 January, 
doctors reported children weakened by starvation were dying from hypothermia.[540] 
On 18 January, the deputy executive director of UNICEF stated the suffering of 
children in Gaza were the "most horrific conditions I have ever seen."[541][542] 
By mid-January 2024, an estimated 10,000 children in Gaza had been killed, with 
thousands more buried under rubble.[543] 

<p>An Action Aid coordinator stated on 27 January that children without winter 
coats were suffering from the cold and rainfall of the winter months, with new 
commercial products prevented from being brought in.[544] An Al Jazeera 
correspondent reported he had witnessed children sleeping in mud-filled tents.[545] 
Describing the impact of war on children's mental health, the Save the Children 
director of humanitarian policy stated the war had "starved and robbed any sense 
of safety and security".[546] On 29 January, UNICEF reported that 16,000 
children were at risk of missing routine vaccinations.[547] 

<p>Ahead of an expected Israel invasion of Rafah, Catherine M. Russell stated, "We 
need Gaza's last remaining hospitals, shelters, markets and water systems to 
stay functional. Without them, hunger and disease will skyrocket, taking more 
child lives."[548] 

<h3>Birth and pregnancy </h3>

<p>An estimated 150 babies were born in Gaza per day since the start of the 
conflict.[549] A pediatric doctor at the Emirati Hospital in Rafah, stated the 
number of premature babies born in Gaza had risen sharply.[550] Newborn babies 
receiving specialized care in the West Bank were separated from their mothers 
who were trapped in Gaza.[551] Oxfam stated newborn babies were dying from 
preventable diseases such as infection, hypothermia, diarrhea, and dehydration.[552] 
By mid-December, parents were struggling to feed newborn babies, as mothers had 
insufficient nutrition to breastfeed.[553] Newborn babies born during the 
conflict died in airstrikes, though some were rescued from the rubble.[554][555] 
A UNOCHA representative stated she had met a woman forced to give birth in the 
street, and that the baby had died.[556] One woman reported being unable to 
bathe her newborns more than ten days after their birth, due to the lack of 
clean water.[557] 

<p>On 18 January 2024, Natalia Kanem, the executive director of the UN Population 
Fund, spoke at the World Economic Forum at Davos, stating the situation was the 
"worst nightmare" the UNPF representative had ever witnessed, as there were 180 
women giving birth daily, sometimes on the streets of Gaza, as the territory's 
health system collapsed.[558] On 17 January, Care International reported a 300 
percent increase in the rate of miscarriage in Gaza since the start of Israel's 
bombing.[559] UNICEF reported on 19 January that 20,000 babies had been born in 
the Gaza Strip since 7 October.[560] UNICEF described each birth as a baby being 
"delivered into hell", and stated "humanity cannot allow this warped version of 
normal to persist any longer."[561] The UN Women's agency reported that since 
the start of the conflict, two mothers in Gaza had been killed every hour, every 
day.[562] WHO reported an increase in stress-induced stillbirths.[563] 

<p>Doctors Without Borders stated that women were giving birth in plastic tents, 
and that those undergoing C-sections were being released within hours.[564] It 
also reported that women were being turned away from hospitals due to 
overcrowding, with some forced to birth in public restrooms.[565] 

<h3>Premature babies </h3>

<p>The plight of Gaza's premature babies gained global attention.[566] In late 
October, Gaza's premature babies faced a critical situation as Medical Aid for 
Palestinians and UNICEF warned that 130 infants were at risk of death due to a 
hospital fuel shortage caused by Israel's siege.[256][257] The lack of fuel led 
to power outages, endangering premature babies in neonatal intensive care units 
(NICUs).[112][113] Despite assurances from the IDF to assist in evacuations, the 
Gaza Health Ministry reported a lack of evacuation mechanisms, resulting in the 
deaths of several infants.[185][186][567] 

<p>The situation escalated in mid-November when Israel launched a raid on al-Shifa 
Hospital.[190][208] Evacuations eventually occurred, facilitated by the 
Palestinian Red Crescent, World Health Organization, and UNOCHA, with 31 
premature babies moved to southern Gaza, with most then to Egypt.[568][569] Not 
all infants were accompanied by their parents, and two died at al-Shifa before 
the evacuation occurred.[205][570] 

<p>The distress extended to Al-Nasr Children's Hospital, bombed by the IDF in early 
November, where medical workers had to leave babies in incubators during 
evacuation.[571][572] Video footage later revealed the aftermath, with five 
premature babies found dead in their incubators.[573] The IDF initially denied 
responsibility, though an Israel official was heard providing assurances to 
evacuate the hospital in a released audio.[574][575] In mid-December, a military 
siege on Kamal Adwan Hospital worsened the situation, as IDF soldiers reportedly 
prevented staff from supporting 12 babies in intensive care.[576] 

<h3>Reactions </h3>

<p>A variety of experts, organizations, and countries have labelled Israel's 
actions against Gaza as genocidal,[577][578][579] using a variety of aspects of 
the humanitarian crisis as evidence.[580][581][582] 

<h4>Aid organizations </h4>

<p>A Doctors Without Borders video shared by Amnesty International head Agn√®s 
Callamard stated, "This brutal annihilation of an entire populations health 
system stretches beyond what humanitarian aid can fix."[583] On 4 December, Red 
Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric Egger visited the Gaza Strip, stating, "the 
things I saw there are beyond anything that anyone should be in a position to 
describe."[584] On 10 December, Bushra Khalidi, an expert with Oxfam, stated the 
situation was no longer "just a catastrophe, it's apocalyptic."[585] 

<p>On 11 December, the presidents of six major humanitarian organizations ‚Äî CARE 
USA, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam America, Refugees 
International, and Save the Children ‚Äî penned a joint op-ed in The New York 
Times in which they stated, "We have seen nothing like the siege of Gaza".[586] 
On 13 December, a group of Israeli human rights and civil society organizations, 
including B'Tselem, penned an open-letter to Joe Biden urging him to use his 
influence to help stop the "catastrophic" humanitarian crisis in Gaza.[587] 
Freedom House warned the humanitarian crisis was growing increasingly dire and 
called on the Israeli government to follow international humanitarian law.[588] 

<p>On 27 December, an MSF representative stated, "You absolutely cannot depict this 
as a humanitarian response: When we cannot guarantee the safety of our teams".[589] 
Mairav Zonszein, a Crisis Group analyst, stated, "It is clear Israel's war 
objective is not eradicating Hamas, but eradicating the ability to live in Gaza."[590] 
B'Tselem reported on 8 January that Israel bore a "positive obligation to allow 
rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian aid, including food" into Gaza.[591] 
On 11 January, the Oxfam Middle East director stated, "The scale and atrocities 
that Israel is visiting upon Gaza are truly shocking. For 100 days the people of 
Gaza have endured a living hell."[592][593] On 14 January, the spokesman for the 
Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) stated, "Gaza has been made unlivable for 
military reasons and all civilians are paying the price."[594] The following day, 
the secretary general of the NRC stated it was the worst humanitarian crises of 
this century.[595] 

<p>In response to a week-long communications blackout across Gaza in January 2024, 
the non-profit Access Now stated, "It is unconscionable to toy with connectivity 
amidst unprecedented violence and unfathomable human suffering."[596] On 9 
February, an International Rescue Committee representative stated, "If they aren't 
killed in the fighting, Palestinian children, women and men will be at risk of 
dying by starvation or disease."[597] On 18 February, the heads of eight major 
humanitarian organizations wrote a joint op-ed, stating, "The speed of the 
deterioration in Gaza is unprecedented in recent history."[598] On 3 March, the 
head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 
stated people in Gaza were in "desperate need of food, water, shelter, and 
medical care, with no sense of safety".[599] Civicus described the situation as 
"one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent global history".[600] 

<h4>United Nations </h4>
<p>On 27 October, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution ES-10/21 
calling for an "immediate and sustained" humanitarian truce and cessation of 
hostilities. 

<p>UNRWA commissioner Philippe Lazzarini described the situation as "bone-chilling," 
and the World Health Organization stated that it was "spiraling out of control."[601][602] 
On October 26, the World Organization declared that Gaza's humanitarian and 
health crisis had "reached catastrophic proportions."[603] Martin Griffiths, the 
United Nations head of Humanitarian Affairs, stated the humanitarian crisis in 
Gaza was the worst he had ever seen in his life, stating, "I don't say that 
lightly. I mean, I started off in my 20s dealing with the Khmer Rouge, and you 
remember how bad that was, the killing fields."[604] Griffith stated it was the 
worst ever because unlike in other humanitarian crises, the people of Gaza had 
nowhere to flee.[605] On November 8, UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described 
the Rafah Crossing as "gates to a living nightmare."[606] 

<p>On 28 November, UN chief Ant√≥nio Guterres stated, the "humanitarian catastrophe 
in Gaza is getting worse by the day."[607] On 3 December, WHO secretary-general 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited Nasser Medical Complex, stating, "Patients 
were receiving care on the floor, screaming in pain... I cannot find words 
strong enough to express our concern over what we're witnessing."[608] On 6 
December, UN chief Ant√≥nio Guterres invoked Article 99 of the Charter of the 
United Nations, stating "We are facing a severe risk of collapse of the 
humanitarian system."[609] A joint statement by more than 20 UN and humanitarian 
organizations described the crisis as "amongst the worst we have witnessed".[610] 

<p>On 8 December, UNICEF spokesperson Thomas White stated, "Civil order is breaking 
down in Gaza... Society is on the brink of full-blown collapse."[611] Philippe 
Lazzarini stated, "By any description, it is definitely the worst situation I 
have ever seen."[612] On 11 December, a UN envoy toured Gaza, leading Ecuador's 
representative to state, "The reality is even worse than what words can speak."[613] 
On 13 December, UN human rights chief Volker T√ºrk stated the crisis was "well 
beyond breakdown."[614] On 19 December, James Elder, spokesperson of UNICEF said 
"I'm furious that children who are recovering from amputations in hospitals are 
then killed in those hospitals."[615] 

<p>Barbara Woodward, the British ambassador to the UN, stated many more would die 
from violence, disease, and famine if action wasn't taken to ease the 
humanitarian crisis.[616] On 31 December, a UNOCHA official stated she was 
afraid casualties were going to increase exponentially due to "conditions which 
are literally unbelievable".[617] On 5 January 2024, the United Nations 
humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths stated, "People are facing the highest 
levels of food insecurity ever recorded."[618] On 7 January, the UNRWA deputy 
director reported severe hunger and an almost collapsed healthcare system, 
stating, "I don't know how much more they can bear before something explodes in 
the southern part of Gaza".[619] 

<p>On 7 January, UN chief Antonio Guterres stated "widespread famine looms" in Gaza,[620] 
to which the UN special rapporteur for health Tlaleng Mofokeng stated Gaza was 
experiencing "deliberate starvation not famine".[621] Speaking at the United 
Nations Security Council on 12 January, Martin Griffiths stated colleagues who 
had made it into northern Gaza in recent days had described "scenes of utter 
horror: Corpses left lying in the road. People with evident signs of starvation 
stopping trucks in search of anything they can get to survive."[622] The World 
Food Programme stated nine out of ten people in northern Gaza were eating less 
than a meal a day.[623] UNGA president Dennis Francis asked, "How much is enough?"[624] 

<p>On 20 January, Antonio Guterres stated, "People in Gaza are dying not only from 
bombs and bullets, but from lack of food & clean water, and hospitals without 
power & medicine."[625] On 27 January, Martin Griffiths stated, "The people of 
Gaza have been enduring unthinkable horrors and deprivation for close to four 
months. Their needs have never been higher."[626] On 30 January, the UN Security 
Council issued a statement saying it was worried about the "dire and rapidly 
deteriorating humanitarian situation".[627] On 7 February, Martin Griffiths 
stated, "More than half of Gaza's population is now crammed in Rafah, a town of 
originally 250,000 people right on Egypt's doorstep. Their living conditions are 
abysmal - they lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease 
and death."[628] On 10 February, Ant√≥nio Guterres stated an Israeli assault on 
Rafah would "exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare".[629] 
On 21 February, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated the situation in Gaza was 
inhumane and described it as a death zone.[630] 

<p>On 5 March, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini stated, "Despite all the horrors that 
Gazans have lived through - and that we have watched - the worst might be yet to 
come."[631] 

<h4>US and Israeli </h4>

<p>Israeli Major General (ret.) Giora Eiland compared Israel's situation to that of 
the United States after Pearl Harbor.[632] He argued that if Israel wanted to 
disarm Hamas, it had "no choice" but to make Gaza a place "that is temporarily 
or permanently impossible to live in".[633][632] This, he stated, was not a "program 
for revenge," but a way to get the hostages back.[634] In an op-ed in Yedioth 
Ahronoth on 19 November, Eiland wrote Israel should not adopt a US narrative 
that "allows" Israel to only fight against militants.[635] Writing for Haaretz, 
Zvi Bar'el argued the humanitarian crisis was an Israeli military weapon that 
could be used as a bargaining chip.[636] In a speech posted by the Knesset 
Channel, MK Tally Gotliv stated, "Without hunger and thirst among the Gazan 
population, we will not be able to recruit collaborators".[637] 

<p>Ghassan Alian, the head of COGAT, stated, "Human animals are dealt with 
accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no 
water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell."[638] In January 2024, a 
COGAT representative denied there was a famine in Gaza, stating, "Don't forget 
that this is an Arab, Gazan population whose DNA is to hoard, certainly when it 
comes to food."[639] Netanyahu stated Israel was allowing in the absolute "minimum" 
amount of aid into Gaza and claimed this was preventing a humanitarian crisis.[640] 

<p>The United States UN representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield vetoed a UN Security 
Council resolution that would have urged humanitarian aid to Gaza, saying it was 
too early to craft a resolution and criticising the one proposed for failing to 
support Israel's right to self-defence.[641] In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, 
conservative American commentator Daniel Henninger speculated Hamas wanted to 
create a humanitarian crisis for publicity purposes.[642] US Senator Chris Van 
Hollen stated "political decisions by the Netanyahu coalition" were delaying the 
delivery of aid into Gaza.[643] 

<h4>Palestinian </h4>

<p>On 4 January 2024, Gaza City mayor Yahya Al-Sarraj made an urgent appeal to the 
international community for fuel "to provide the necessary support mechanisms to 
provide water, sanitation and hygiene services to serve all residents of the 
Gaza Strip".[644] On 5 January, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry stated the 
humanitarian crisis in Rafah was straining the international community's 
credibility, stating, "The Israeli government continues its deepening campaign 
of genocide, comprehensive destruction, and displacement in the Gaza Strip".[645] 
On 14 January, the Foreign Ministry stated, "The Israeli occupation has turned 
Gaza into an uninhabitable place, committed horrific crimes, and forcibly 
displaced approximately 2 million people".[646] The Ministry stated Israel was 
claiming self-defense to justify making Gaza uninhabitable.[647] 

<h4>Other states </h4>

<p>On 8 January 2024, Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi condemned Israel's 
actions in Gaza, stating, "The Israeli aggression on Gaza has exceeded all 
humanitarian, legal and moral limits".[648] 

<p>On 9 January 2024, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron admitted he is "worried" 
that Israel has "taken action that might be in breach of international law", 
saying he wanted Israel to restore water supplies to Gaza.[649] Cameron stated 
on 26 January, "The scale of suffering in Gaza is unimaginable".[650] Sarah 
Champion, a Labor MP, stated, "I find it utterly wicked and immoral that 
international conventions [in Gaza] are not being respected, particularly when 
it comes to medical facilities".[651] Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi stated, "We 
cannot allow this humanitarian disaster to continue",[652] and described it as "a 
tragedy for humankind and a disgrace for civilization".[653] Yousef Al Otaiba, 
the UAE ambassador to the United States, called for a ceasefire, writing, "Half 
of the people are starving. The medical system has collapsed. Safe water is 
scarce. An impending Israeli offensive will displace millions."[654] 

<p>Speaking about Rafah, a German government spokesperson stated on 19 February 
2024 that although the full scope of the crisis was difficult to assess, "Everyone 
recognizes that it is catastrophic."[655] William, Prince of Wales stated, "There 
is a desperate need for increased humanitarian support to Gaza."[656] On 3 March, 
France's Foreign Minister St√©phane S√©journ√© stated, "The humanitarian situation 
in Gaza has been catastrophic for several weeks, if not several months. And this 
is creating indefensible and unjustifiable situations for which the Israelis are 
accountable".[657] 

<h3>Resolution efforts </h3>

<p>In a call on 20 November, Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President 
Emmanuel Macron discussed measures to avoid the humanitarian crisis from getting 
worse.[658] In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on November 11, 2023, the Organisation of 
Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League held an emergency meeting on the Gaza 
humanitarian crisis created by the war.[659] On 5 December, Cyprus President 
Nikos Christodoulides visited Egypt and Jordan in attempt to establish a 
humanitarian aid corridor to Gaza.[660] The UN appointed Sigrid Kaag in the 
newly created position of senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for 
Gaza.[661] 

<p>On December 6, United Nations secretary-general Ant√≥nio Guterres invoked Article 
99 of the UN Charter, that is: "The Secretary-General may bring to the attention 
of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the 
maintenance of international peace and security."[662][663] Guterres cited the 
situation as a threat to "international peace and security" and "a severe risk 
of collapse of the humanitarian system" which he argued have irreversible 
impacts for Palestinians.[664] By invoking Article 99, Guterres is pushing the 
Security Council to call for a cease fire.[665] 

<h3>Refugees </h3>

<p>At the beginning of the war, Egypt announced it was closing the Rafah Crossing 
to Gaza, one of only three exit points along the Gaza border.[666][667] Egypt 
cited fears about permanent displacement and a possible refugee crisis, 
particularly if Israel refused to allow the refugees back into Gaza after the 
war.[668][l] Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu sought to convince Egypt to accept 
Gazan refugees.[670] 

<p>Jordan also expressed reluctance to receive Palestinian refugees.[671] King 
Abdullah II of Jordan warned Israel against pushing Palestinians into Jordan, 
emphasizing the need to address the humanitarian situation within both Gaza and 
the West Bank.[672] 

<p>In Europe, Humza Yousaf, the First Minister of Scotland, urged the international 
community to establish a refugee program for Gaza.[673][674] Yousaf stated 
Scotland was ready to offer sanctuary to refugees, and called on the UK to 
create a resettlement scheme.[674][m] Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stated 
the Netherlands was discussing the possibility of accepting sick and wounded 
Palestinian children into the country.[675] 

<p>In the United States, left-wing politicians, including Representatives 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman, emphasized the US's historical role 
accepting refugees and called for the acceptance of Gazan refugees.[671] Right-wing 
politicians, such as former-President Donald Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis, 
both argued for barring admittance of any refugees from Gaza.[671] Former US 
ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said that Palestinian refugees from Gaza 
should be accepted by Middle Eastern countries.[676] President Joe Biden did not 
announce any plans to admit refugees, but stated $100 million in aid would be 
given to Gaza.[671]

<p>^ Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan responded directly to Guterres, stating, "Shame 
on [Guterres]... More than 30 minors - among them a 9-month-old baby as well as 
toddlers and children who witnessed their parents being murdered in cold blood - 
are being held against their will in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is the problem in 
Gaza, not Israel's actions to eliminate this terrorist organization."[8][9] 

<p>^ Many were sheltering at the hospital, as it was the last functioning one in 
northern Gaza.[161][162] The Gaza Ministry of Health stated 200 patients were 
evacuated from the hospital, while an estimated 500 patients remained.[163][164] 

<p>^ Ashraf al-Qudra, a doctor at al-Shifa, stated the hospital was completely out 
of service, as the Israeli army shot "everything that moves."[183] 

<p>^ Three dozen premature babies, were still sheltering at the time of the raid.[190] 
Doctors reported 40 patients at al-Shifa died.[191] 

<p>^ Robert Mardini, director general of the Red Cross, described the situation at 
al-Shifa as "unbearably desperate."[196] 

<p>^ The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor reported it had received reports 
that WHO either unwittingly or knowingly facilitated the doctors' arrests.[245] 

<p>^ The Italian Joint Operations Command also announced a plan to build an Armed 
Forces-owned field hospital within the Gaza Strip, although the designation of 
the specific site was subject to the assurance of basic safety conditions in the 
chosen area.[261][262] The Ministry of Defence authorized medical staff from 
foreign countries and international organizations to join the personnel of both 
the hospital ship and the field hospital;[261][262] as a result, six between 
physicians and nurses from the Qatar Armed Forces, as well as a medical team 
affiliated to the Francesca Rava Foundation [it], joined the staff of the ship.[262] 
However, due to the constant escalation of the war in the Gaza Strip, the 
Vulcano was authorized to change its path following a NATO meeting, and arrived 
in Al'Arish, Egypt on 3 December. 

<p>^ In 2022, a "man-made cavity" was discovered under the grounds of an UNRWA 
school in Gaza.[333] 

<p>^ Mohammed Mustafa, the chief economist of the Palestine Investment Fund, 
estimated rebuilding Gaza's homes alone would cost around $15 billion USD.[394] 

<p>^ Service partially returned on 19 January, making the seven-day-long blackout 
the longest of the war thus far.[437] 

<p>^ Shortly after these comments, the Israeli government revoked Hastings' visa[486] 

<p>^ On 2 November, Egypt said it would allow 7,000 dual citizens to exit through 
the Rafah border crossing.[669] 

<p>^ Yousaf also called on Israel not to resort to collective punishment and 
emphasized the need for medical evacuation support for injured civilians. Yousaf 
has personal ties to Gaza, with family members there. He stressed unity and 
safety for all communities in Scotland. The UK government, led by conservative 
Rishi Sunak, did not issue an official response to Yousaf's comments.
