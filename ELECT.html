<h1>Thoughts on the Doctrine of Election</h1>

<h2>Tuesday, February 27, 2024</h2>

<h3>By Joseph D.Klotz</h3>

<p>As a Confessional Lutheran living in what some in the Lutheran blogosphere have
called the "desert of American Evangelicalism," one gets accustomed to being
ignored. No one quite knows what to do with Confessional Lutherans.
Consequently, we usually get left out of the debates, and our doctrine is not
well-known. We look like Roman Catholics, most of the time. We talk about
baptism a LOT, and how salvation comes only by the grace of God through faith
in Jesus Christ alone. Most American Evangelicals don't know what to do with
us, if we're even on their radar at all.</p>

<p>Mostly, we are not.</p>

<p>This is evident when the discussion turns to something like the doctrine of
Election. You've got your Calvinists, and you've got your Arminians; your
predestination people and your free will guys. Either God has predestined
everybody for where they're going or we all have to make a decision for Jesus
and pray the sinners prayer.</p>

<p>Then there are the Lutherans. We don't fit into either of those categories. We
acknowledge that man has free will, but only in matters that do not pertain to
salvation. Where conversion is concerned, we acknowledge that scripture teaches
we are dead in our trespasses and sins (Ephesians 2:1ff.). We also understand
that God has predestined the elect to salvation in Christ before the foundation
of the world. However, - and here's where we lose the Calvinists - we
acknowledge that scripture teaches that a believer can fall away.</p>

<p>Calvin wrote that salvation is not preached to all people equally. The reason
why, he says, is a mystery. Calvin defines predestination as the doctrine that
some people are chosen by God to be saved, and others are chosen by God to be
damned. This is quite different from how the doctrine of election is understood
from Holy Scripture by the Lutheran reformers. Calvin admits that this teaching
might sound scary and confusing at first, but it is, in fact, "useful and
pleasant." (Calvin, 1526) Calvin writes that the doctrine of election shows man
that salvation is truly monergistic. To him, the fact that God gives salvation
to some and withholds it from others, Calvin says, simultaneously glorifies God
and humbles man. (Calvin, 1526)</p>

<p>Calvin and the Lutheran Confessions both agree that the doctrine of election
is, in Calvin's words, "useful and pleasant"; that it is intended ot be a
comfort, and to showcase the glory of God. But Christianity does not teach
fatalism. Fatalism is the idea that nothing you do makes any difference because
everything is pre-ordained. Christian faith is knowing God works all things,
even the ones we think are bad, for the good of those who love Him, who are
called according to His purpose in Christ. And here we come to the first and
greatest difference between a Reformed and a Confessional Lutheran
understanding of election: it can only be understood in Christ.</p>

<p>Calvin says that God reveals His will to men, and that we must not seek that
which God has kept hidden. Calvin says that we find the revealed will of God in
God's word. This is true, and the Lutheran Confessions agree. Calvin, however,
seems to go beyond what Scripture says when he teaches that God has created
some men specifically for damnation.</p>

<p>To Calvin, God is the cause of salvation to those who are saved; God is also
the cause of damnation to those who are damned. This is what Calvin means when
he writes that all are not "created on equal terms." (Calvin, 1536) In other
words, Calvin teaches that God created some people specifically to be saved,
and other specifically to be damned. Those so created have no chance either to
fall if they are the elect, or to be saved if they are the reprobate.</p>

<p>Calvin cites Deuteronomy 32:8-9 to show that God does not reveal the reason He
saves certain people and damns others. As God declared to the Israelites
through Moses, Calvin says, God chose the Israelites because He wanted to; it
was not because of anything God saw in them, or that they merited God's favor.
Calvin says that here God keeps the reason the elect are chosen a secret, but
this isn't entirely true. God does indeed reveal how and why the elect are
saved: they are saved by God's grace through faith in Christ alone. Moreover,
scripture also declares that the lost are damned because of their lack of
faith, not because God predestined them to be lost and condemned.</p>

<p>When discussing eternal election, the Lutheran reformers make a distinction
between God's eternal election and God's eternal foreknowledge. God's
foreknowledge means simply that God sees and knows all things before they
happen. Foreknowledge applies to all creatures. Election does not apply to all
creatures. Election only applies to those people who are in Christ. (McCain,
2005)</p>

<p>God's eternal election simply means those whom God has predestined to salvation
in Christ from before the foundation of the world. Election, therefore, does
not include the wicked. On the contrary, it only includes the godly, i.e. those
people who have faith in Christ. Those who are predestined to salvation are
those who are in Christ.</p>

<p>Here we enter the territory of another fundamental difference between Reformed
and Confessional Lutheran theology: paradox. Confessional Lutheran theologians
do not feel the need to resolve paradox when it is found it Holy Scripture.
Reformed theologians make the rational argument that if God chose one group of
men to be saved, then that means he chose the remaining group of men to be
damned. That is not, however, what the Bible says. In short, Scripture teaches
the following paradox: 1) God wants all men to be saved and come to a knowledge
of the truth; 2) God is completely responsible for working repentance and faith
in men by the means of His word; 3) Some men reject God's gracious gift and are
not saved; 4) Those men who are lost are responsible for their own damnation,
not God.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that Calvin does not seem to recognize that the lost are
lost because of their own sin; because of their own failure to believe in
Christ, and not because God decreed them to be reprobate. Consider the fact
that Non-Israelites could become a part of the nation of Israel. People like
Rahab the prostitute were accepted as part of God's chosen people, not because
of their bloodline, but because of their faith. Again, consider Saul. He was
the annointed king of Israel, yet he was rejected by God because he was
unfaithful.</p>

<p>Calvin sees the choosing of Israel by God as a sort of general election. The
explanation he for why most of Israel fell away even though they were part of
the elect nation and only a remnant remained is troubling. Calvin explains
that, while God did elect the entire body of Jacob's descendants, He did not
immediately give all of them the Holy Spirit. According to Calvin, this
witholding of the Spirit is why most of elect Israel fell away and only a
remnant was caused to persevere. (Calvin, 1536) Where Calvin found such a
horrifying notion is anyone's guess. It does not come from Scripture.</p>

<p>But Calvin continues, asserting that God is not unjust to choose some men to
reprobation. Indeed, He would not be unjust if that were the case. All men are,
after all, in a fallen state. God would have been justified in destroying the
entire fallen creation, and starting over again. But Calvin also ascribes man's
corrupt and fallen state to God's will. (Calvin, 1536) Scripture tells us that
isn't the case. God is not the source of evil, nor is God the cause of sin.
Rather, Adam's will and the will of the devil are the cause of mankinds fall,
and the introduction of sin and death into creation.</p>

<p>God may not be the cause of man's fall into sin as Calvin says. God did,
however, allow the Fall to happen. And, along with everything else, God works
those things to the good of those elect in Christ.</p>

<p>Calvin says that God issues His call to faith by the preaching of the Gospel.
According to Calvin, however, though the Gospel goes out to the elect and to
the reprobate alike, God only makes it effectual in those whom He has elected.
Those who are reprobate, therefore, do not have the opportunity or the ability
to believe; God, according to His will, has rendered the power of the Gospel
ineffective in them. (Calvin, 1536)</p>

<p>Predestination is not a trick. God does not say outwardly that salvation is for
all people, but secretly not mean it. This would mean that God had two
contradictory wills, which cannot be because Scripture tells us so. (McCain,
2005) God punishes such duplicity. He does not reward it.</p>

<p>God would indeed be a liar and a hypocrate if His invitation was extended to
all people through His word, but secretly in His heart He knew there were some
people He would damn anyway, no matter what. God condemns this type of
wickedness (Psalm 5:9; 12:2-4). Man is, on the contrary, responsible for his
own damnation by resisting and rejecting the Holy Spirit as He works through
God's word.</p>

<p>God reveals His will by His call to preach the Gospel to all people. He works
through that word to enlighten, convert, and save. The Gospel is the power of
God for salvation; God wants men to receive, believe, and obey His word. Christ
merited the redemption of the entire human race on the cross. Through word and
sacrament Christ gives us the benefits of what He has merited. That is to say
that the Holy Spirit working through those means works conversion; works
repentance and faith in Christ for the forgiveness of sins in us. Moreover, the
Spirit will justify, sanctify, and protect those in whom He has done such work
if we do not abandon Christ and His Word. (McCain, 2005)</p>

<p>He will save eternally at the Resurrection on the Last Day those who persevere.
