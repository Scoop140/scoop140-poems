<h2>Hail, True Body</h2>
<p><i>Based on Ave Verum Corpus</i></p>
<p>Hail, true Body, born of Mary,<br>
Virgin pure and undefiled:<br>
On the cross for sinners weary,<br>
Sacrificed and reconciled:</p>
<p></p>Pierced and streaming blood and water,<br>
Grant us grace in death's dark hour.<br>
O, sweetest Jesus!<br>
O, blessed Jesus!<br>
Very God and man we praise You!</p>

<h2>Flying Windows</h2>

<h4><em>by Joseph D. Klotz</em></h4>

<p>Flying Windows,<br>
Flooding my computer screen;<br>
Red and yellow, blue and green;<br>
Not since Y2K were seen.<br>
Mesmerizing.</p>

<p>Flying Windows:<br>
Flickering, methodic pace;<br>
Shining, electronic lace;<br>
To the sound of Hearts of Space.<br>
It was haunting.</p>

<p>Flying Windows:<br>
Lying in my dorm room bed,<br>
I watch the screen on which they sped;<br>
Time has stopped inside my head.<br>
Meditation.</p>

<p>Flying Windows:<br>
Again across the screen they zoom,<br>
And illuminate my room.<br>
I with my ancient self commune.<br>
Ah! Nostalgia.</p>

<p>Flying Windows:<br>
The wife upon the bed does lie,<br>
Late at night, unclosing eye,<br>
Willing my PC to die<br>
So she can sleep.</p>

<h2>At the Round Earth's Imagined Corners</h2>
<h4><em><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne">John Donne</a></em></h4>
<h4><em>Divine Poems</em></h4>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>At the round earths imagin'd corners, blow<br>
Your trumpets, Angells, and arise, arise<br>
From death, you numberlesse infinities<br>
Of soules, and to your scattred bodies goe,<br>
All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow,<br>
Despaire, law, chance, hath slaine, and you whose eyes,<br>
Shall behold God, and never tast deaths woe.<br>
But let them sleepe, Lord, and mee mourne a space,<br>
For, if above all these, my sinnes abound,<br>
'Tis late to aske abundance of thy grace,<br>
When wee are there; here on this lowly ground,<br>
Teach mee how to repent; for that's as good<br>
As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon, with thy blood.</p>

<h2>Ode to My Cat on His First Birthday</h2>
<h3>(or...You're So Dumb)</h3>

<h4><em>Joseph D. Klotz</em></html>

<p>You're so dumb.<br>
Sitting in the window there,<br>
Furry face and vacant stare;<br>
Vibrating without a care.<br>
<em>I love you.</em></p>

<p>You're so dumb.<br>
All you want to do is eat;<br>
When you get mad you take your feet<br>
And scratch my arm down to the meat.<br>
<em>I love you.</em></p>

<p>You're so dumb.<br>
You run around like you are manic;<br>
From living room up to the attic;<br>
Tiny brain all filled with static.<br>
<em>I love you.</em></p>

<p>You're so dumb.<br>
I'm worried that there'll come a day<br>
When you get out and run away.<br>
So, furry idiot, I say:</p>

<p>Stay inside.<br>
<em>I love you.</em></p>

<h2> Tobacco is a Dirty Weed</h2>
<h4><em>Graham Lee Hemminger</em></h4>
 <p>Tobacco is a dirty weed,<br>
 I like it.<br>
 It satisfies no normal need,<br>
 I like it.<br>
 It makes you thin, it makes you lean,<br>
 It takes the hair right off your bean.<br>
 It's the worst darn stuff I've ever seen.<br>
 I like it.</p>

<h2>Holy Sonnets</h2>
<h3><em>Joseph D. Klotz</em></h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>All men must die, regardless of their good,<br>
   Or lack thereof. Foul death infects us all.<br>
   Because old Adam, tempted, ate the food,<br>
   Thus dying, they would die with opened eyes,<br>
   And to posterity their gift bequeath.<br>
   Now, separated from God's paradise,<br>
   Cast into outer darkness on the heath.<br>
   How can this be God's justice to pronounce<br>
   A condmnation on those who did not<br>
   Commit the sinful act God would denounce<br>
   And cause mankind with mis'ry to be fraught?<br>
   You fool! You share his flesh and blood; that's why<br>
   All sons of Adam are condemned to die.</p>

<p>II.</p>
<p>All sons of Adam are condemned to die.<br>
   Because of him, all flesh was made corrupt.<br>
   To minimize the damage of the Lie,<br>
   God did the way to Paradise obstruct.<br>
   He barred the man from accessing the Tree<br>
   Of Life. he did not want the man to live<br>
   Forever in the grip of sin, but free.<br>
   Thus in the taking, God did truly give<br>
   To human kind a chance to be released<br>
   From bondage to the devil, and to sin.<br>
   But man cannot oppose this awful beast;<br>
   That is a fight man cannot hope to win.<br>
   The One to kill the beast must be the Seed;<br>
   His people out of bondage He shall lead.</p>

<p>III.</p>
<p>His people out of bondage He shall lead,<br>
   And crush the serpent's head under His heel.<br>
   The serpent in the struggle makes Him bleed,<br>
   But in the end the serpent, too will kneel;<br>
   As ev'ry knee shall bend and head shall bow<br>
   When finally the world has been restored.<br>
   And Christ returns and none can disavow<br>
   That He, the Word Incarnate, is the LORD;<br>
   The Promised Seed who took on human flesh;<br>
   The sacrifice for sin, destroying death.<br>
   God's blood shed on the cross man does refresh,<br>
   Restoring him, and quickening his breath.<br>
   Lord, clothe me with Your righteousness and keep<br>
   Me safe until Your coming while I sleep.</p>

<p>IV.</p>
<p>The cruel net traps fish that swim along,<br>
   And dumbly they are hauled to their demise.<br>
   The bird among the trees singing his song<br>
   Is taken in a snare by one more wise.<br>
   They have no concept of the one who stalks them<br>
   With grim determination to devour<br>
   His prey; and doing what has been ordained them<br>
   In ign'rance to await their final hour.<br>
   It's man who nets the fish and snares the bird,<br>
   But he himself is prey to net and snare.<br>
   Our predator, relentless, speaks no words<br>
   As he approaches; we are unaware.<br>
   But even though we end up in the grave<br>
   Our Lord has come to earth mankind to save.</p>

<p>V.</p>
<p>Our Lord has come to earth mankind to save.<br>
   And, taking on the flesh of mortal man<br>
   In Mary's virgin womb, that flesh He gave<br>
   Over to death, as was the Father's plan.<br>
   The sinless Son of Man lay in the cresche,<br>
   Eternal power in servant's form eloigned;<br>
   Immanuel, God with us in the flesh,<br>
   Divine and Human natures in Christ joined.<br>
   The miracle is that Christ to us came,<br>
   Despite the fact we were His enemies;<br>
   Becoming sin for us, enduring shame;<br>
   Th'indulgance won by Christ is plenary.<br>
   Christ's death upon the cross mankind does save;<br>
   He rescues us from sin, Satan, and grave.</p>

    <h2>Japanese Grocery</h2>
    <h3><em>Joseph D. Klotz</em></h3>
    <p> The store's compact<br>                            
        Nothing's out of whack<br>                         
        People shuffeling to and fro, and back to back,<br>
        Asian people wearing masks;<br>
        It's a Japanese grocery.</p>
                                                       
    <p> They've got freeze dried squid<br>                 
        That will make you flip your lid<br>
        It's right on display, they don't keep it hid<br>
        It costs 25 quid<br>
        At the Japanese grocery.<br>
                                                       
    <p> So many things on display,<br>
        While I'm looking I always feel in the way;<br>
        I don't know what they say,<br>    
        But that's ok; I'm an American<br>
        At the Japanese grocery.<br>                 
                                                       
    <p> If you're looking for a fight<br>
        Better go someplace else tonight;<br>
        But if you want to grab a bite<br>              
        They treat you alright<br>                 
        Down at the Japanese grocery.<br>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><em> I wrote this poem after a trip with my family to the Japanese grocery store.
 It was pretty amazing.<br> This poem is intended as an homage to John Cooper Clarke, and should be read in his

<h2>What About You, Boy?</h2>
<h3><em>Frederick Manfred</em></h3>

     <p>What about you, boy?<br>
     Is your work coming along?<br>
     Are you still making candles<br>
     Against darkness and wrong?<br>
     The whole thing is to blast.<br>
     Blast and blast again. To fill the Black<br>
     With songs, poems, temples, paintings,<br>
     Anything at all. Attack. Attack.<br>
     Open up and let go.<br>
     Even if it's only blowing. But blast.<br>
     And I say this loving my God.<br>
     Because we are all He has at last.<br>
     So what about it, boy?<br>
     Is your work going well?<br>
     Are you still lighting lamps<br>
     Against darkness and Hell?<sbr>

<h2>Dulce et Decorum Est</h2>
<h3><em>Wilfred Owen</em></h3>

     <p>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br>
     Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br>
     Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,<br>
     And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br>
     Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,<br>
     But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind<br>
     Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>
     Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</p>

     <p>Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! -- An extasy of fumbling<br>
     Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,<br>
     But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br>
     And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime. --<br>
     Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,<br>
     As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</p>

     <p>In all my dreams before my helpless sight,<br>
     He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</p>

     <p>If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace<br>
     Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br>
     And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br>
     His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;<br>
     If you could hear, at every jold, the blood<br>
     Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br>
     Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br>
     Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, --<br>
     My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br>
     The old Lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est<br>
     Pro patria mori.</i></p>
