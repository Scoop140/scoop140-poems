<h2> Tobacco is a Dirty Weed</h2>
<h4><em>Graham Lee Hemminger</em></h4>
 <p>Tobacco is a dirty weed,<br>
 I like it.<br>
 It satisfies no normal need,<br>
 I like it.<br>
 It makes you thin, it makes you lean,<br>
 It takes the hair right off your bean.<br>
 It's the worst darn stuff I've ever seen.<br>
 I like it.</p>

<h2>Holy Sonnets</h2>
<h3><em>Joseph D. Klotz</em></h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>All men must die, regardless of their good,<br>
   Or lack thereof. Foul death infects us all.<br>
   Because old Adam, tempted, ate the food,<br>
   Thus dying, they would die with opened eyes,<br>
   And to posterity their gift bequeath.<br>
   Now, separated from God's paradise,<br>
   Cast into outer darkness on the heath.<br>
   How can this be God's justice to pronounce<br>
   A condmnation on those who did not<br>
   Commit the sinful act God would denounce<br>
   And cause mankind with mis'ry to be fraught?<br>
   You fool! You share his flesh and blood; that's why<br>
   All sons of Adam are condemned to die.</p>

<p>II.</p>
<p>All sons of Adam are condemned to die.<br>
   Because of him, all flesh was made corrupt.<br>
   To minimize the damage of the Lie,<br>
   God did the way to Paradise obstruct.<br>
   He barred the man from accessing the Tree<br>
   Of Life. he did not want the man to live<br>
   Forever in the grip of sin, but free.<br>
   Thus in the taking, God did truly give<br>
   To human kind a chance to be released<br>
   From bondage to the devil, and to sin.<br>
   But man cannot oppose this awful beast;<br>
   That is a fight man cannot hope to win.<br>
   The One to kill the beast must be the Seed;<br>
   His people out of bondage He shall lead.</p>

<p>III.</p>
<p>His people out of bondage He shall lead,<br>
   And crush the serpent's head under His heel.<br>
   The serpent in the struggle makes Him bleed,<br>
   But in the end the serpent, too will kneel;<br>
   As ev'ry knee shall bend and head shall bow<br>
   When finally the world has been restored.<br>
   And Christ returns and none can disavow<br>
   That He, the Word Incarnate, is the LORD;<br>
   The Promised Seed who took on human flesh;<br>
   The sacrifice for sin, destroying death.<br>
   God's blood shed on the cross man does refresh,<br>
   Restoring him, and quickening his breath.<br>
   Lord, clothe me with Your righteousness and keep<br>
   Me safe until Your coming while I sleep.</p>

<p>IV.</p>
<p>The cruel net traps fish that swim along,<br>
   And dumbly they are hauled to their demise.<br>
   The bird among the trees singing his song<br>
   Is taken in a snare by one more wise.<br>
   They have no concept of the one who stalks them<br>
   With grim determination to devour<br>
   His prey; and doing what has been ordained them<br>
   In ign'rance to await their final hour.<br>
   It's man who nets the fish and snares the bird,<br>
   But he himself is prey to net and snare.<br>
   Our predator, relentless, speaks no words<br>
   As he approaches; we are unaware.<br>
   But even though we end up in the grave<br>
   Our Lord has come to earth mankind to save.</p>

<p>V.</p>
<p>Our Lord has come to earth mankind to save.<br>
   And, taking on the flesh of mortal man<br>
   In Mary's virgin womb, that flesh He gave<br>
   Over to death, as was the Father's plan.<br>
   The sinless Son of Man lay in the cresche,<br>
   Eternal power in servant's form eloigned;<br>
   Immanuel, God with us in the flesh,<br>
   Divine and Human natures in Christ joined.<br>
   The miracle is that Christ to us came,<br>
   Despite the fact we were His enemies;<br>
   Becoming sin for us, enduring shame;<br>
   Th'indulgance won by Christ is plenary.<br>
   Christ's death upon the cross mankind does save;<br>
   He rescues us from sin, Satan, and grave.</p>

    <h2>Japanese Grocery</h2>
    <h3><em>Joseph D. Klotz</em></h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The store's compact<br>                            
        Nothing's out of whack<br>                         
        People shuffeling to and fro, and back to back,<br>
        Asian people wearing masks;<br>
        It's a Japanese grocery.</p>
                                                       
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> They've got freeze dried squid<br>                 
        That will make you flip your lid<br>
        It's right on display, they don't keep it hid<br>
        It costs 25 quid<br>
        At the Japanese grocery.<br>
                                                       
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> So many things on display,<br>
        While I'm looking I always feel in the way;<br>
        I don't know what they say,<br>    
        But that's ok; I'm an American<br>
        At the Japanese grocery.<br>                 
                                                       
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> If you're looking for a fight<br>
        Better go someplace else tonight;<br>
        But if you want to grab a bite<br>              
        They treat you alright<br>                 
        Down at the Japanese grocery.<br>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><em> I wrote this poem after a trip with my family to the Japanese grocery store.
 It was pretty amazing.<br> This poem is intended as an homage to John Cooper Clarke, and should be read in his
 style.</em></p>

<h2>What About You, Boy?</h2>
<h3><em>Frederick Manfred</em></h3>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">What about you, boy?<br>
     Is your work coming along?<br>
     Are you still making candles<br>
     Against darkness and wrong?<br>
     The whole thing is to blast.<br>
     Blast and blast again. To fill the Black<br>
     With songs, poems, temples, paintings,<br>
     Anything at all. Attack. Attack.<br>
     Open up and let go.<br>
     Even if it's only blowing. But blast.<br>
     And I say this loving my God.<br>
     Because we are all He has at last.<br>
     So what about it, boy?<br>
     Is your work going well?<br>
     Are you still lighting lamps<br>
     Against darkness and Hell?<sbr>

<h2>Dulce et Decorum Est</h2>
<h3><em>Wilfred Owen</em></h3>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br>
     Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br>
     Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,<br>
     And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br>
     Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,<br>
     But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind<br>
     Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>
     Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! -- An extasy of fumbling<br>
     Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,<br>
     But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br>
     And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime. --<br>
     Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,<br>
     As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">In all my dreams before my helpless sight,<br>
     He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace<br>
     Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br>
     And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br>
     His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;<br>
     If you could hear, at every jold, the blood<br>
     Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br>
     Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br>
     Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, --<br>
     My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br>
     The old Lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est<br>
     Pro patria mori.</i></p>

<h2>O Sacred Head Now Wounded (stz. 5)</h2>
<h3><em>Paul Gerhardt, 1656,</em></h3>
<h4><em>(tr. James Waddell Alexander, 1830, a.)</em></h4>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Be near when I am dying;<br>
      <span class="indented">O! show Thy Cross to me;</span><br>
     Lord, on Thy help relying<br>
      <span class="indented"> Come Thou and set me free;</span><br>
     These eyes, new faith receiving,<br>

<h2> Lord, Thee I Love with All My Heart (stanza 3)</h2>
<h3><em>Martin Schalling, c. 1567</em></h3>
<h4><em>(Tr., Catherine Winkworth, 1863, alt.)</em></h4>

 <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lord, let at last Thine angels come,<br>
 <span class="indented">To Abram's bosom bear me home,<br>
 That I may die unfearing;</p>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span class="indented">And in its narrow chamber keep<br>
 My body safe in peaceful sleep<br>
 <span class="indented">Until Thy reappearing.</p>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;">And then from death awaken me<br>
 <span class="indented">That these mine eyes with joy may see,<br>
 O son of God, Thy glorious face,<br>
 <span class="indented">My Savior and my Fount of grace.</p>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
 <span class="indented">My prayer attend, my prayer attend,<br>
 And I will praise Thee without end.</p>
