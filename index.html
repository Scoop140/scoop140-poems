    <h2>Japanese Grocery</h2>
    <h3><em>Joseph D. Klotz</em></h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The store's compact<br>                            
        Nothing's out of whack<br>                         
        People shuffeling to and fro, and back to back,<br>
        Asian people wearing masks;<br>
        It's a Japanese grocery.</p>
                                                       
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> They've got freeze dried squid<br>                 
        That will make you flip your lid<br>
        It's right on display, they don't keep it hid<br>
        It costs 25 quid<br>
        At the Japanese grocery.<br>
                                                       
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> So many things on display,<br>
        While I'm looking I always feel in the way;<br>
        I don't know what they say,<br>    
        But that's ok; I'm an American<br>
        At the Japanese grocery.<br>                 
                                                       
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> If you're looking for a fight<br>
        Better go someplace else tonight;<br>
        But if you want to grab a bite<br>              
        They treat you alright<br>                 
        Down at the Japanese grocery.<br>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><em> I wrote this poem after a trip with my family to the Japanese grocery store.
 It was pretty amazing.<br> This poem is intended as an homage to John Cooper Clarke, and should be read in his
 style.</em></p>

<h2>What About You, Boy?</h2>
<h3><em>Frederick Manfred</em></h3>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">What about you, boy?<br>
     Is your work coming along?<br>
     Are you still making candles<br>
     Against darkness and wrong?<br>
     The whole thing is to blast.<br>
     Blast and blast again. To fill the Black<br>
     With songs, poems, temples, paintings,<br>
     Anything at all. Attack. Attack.<br>
     Open up and let go.<br>
     Even if it's only blowing. But blast.<br>
     And I say this loving my God.<br>
     Because we are all He has at last.<br>
     So what about it, boy?<br>
     Is your work going well?<br>
     Are you still lighting lamps<br>
     Against darkness and Hell?<sbr>

<h2>Dulce et Decorum Est</h2>
<h3><em>Wilfred Owen</em></h3>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br>
     Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br>
     Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,<br>
     And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br>
     Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,<br>
     But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind<br>
     Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>
     Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! -- An extasy of fumbling<br>
     Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,<br>
     But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br>
     And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime. --<br>
     Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,<br>
     As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">In all my dreams before my helpless sight,<br>
     He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;">If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace<br>
     Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br>
     And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br>
     His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;<br>
     If you could hear, at every jold, the blood<br>
     Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br>
     Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br>
     Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, --<br>
     My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br>
     The old Lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est<br>
     Pro patria mori.</i></p>

<h2>O Sacred Head Now Wounded (stz. 5)</h2>
<h3><em>Paul Gerhardt, 1656,</em></h3>
<h4><em>(tr. James Waddell Alexander, 1830, a.)</em></h4>

     <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Be near when I am dying;<br>
      <span class="indented">O! show Thy Cross to me;</span><br>
     Lord, on Thy help relying<br>
      <span class="indented"> Come Thou and set me free;</span><br>
     These eyes, new faith receiving,<br>
      <span class="indented"> From Thee shall never move;</span><br>
     For he who dies believing<br>
      <span class="indented"> Dies safely in Thy love.</span></p>

<h2> Lord, Thee I Love with All My Heart (stanza 3)</h2>
<h3><em>Martin Schalling, c. 1567</em></h3>
<h4><em>(Tr., Catherine Winkworth, 1863, alt.)</em></h4>

 <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lord, let at last Thine angels come,<br>
 <span class="indented">To Abram's bosom bear me home,<br>
 That I may die unfearing;</p>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span class="indented">And in its narrow chamber keep<br>
 My body safe in peaceful sleep<br>
 <span class="indented">Until Thy reappearing.</p>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;">And then from death awaken me<br>
 <span class="indented">That these mine eyes with joy may see,<br>
 O son of God, Thy glorious face,<br>
 <span class="indented">My Savior and my Fount of grace.</p>
 <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
 <span class="indented">My prayer attend, my prayer attend,<br>
 And I will praise Thee without end.</p>
