<h2> Video Footage of Isaac Goodlow Shooting Released</h2>

<h3> Saturday, March 2, 2024</h3>

<p> CAROL STREAM, Ill. -- Carol Stream police have released the bodycam video of
 last month's shooting that killed Isaac Goodlow. Goodlow was shot and killed
 by police in the early hours of February 3 in his apartment.

<p> On Friday, Carol Stream police released an edited video of the shooting. A
 Freedom of Information Act request by WGN News for the video has not been
 returned at this time.

<p> Goodlow, 30, was shot and killed in an incident that took place just before 5
 a.m. Saturday in the 200 block of East St. Charles Road at Carol Stream's
 Villagebrook Apartments when two officers called to a domestic violence
 incident discharged their firearms.

<p> According to the Carol Stream Police Department, officers responded to
 reports of domestic violence at the apartment complex just after 4 a.m.
 Saturday and found a woman outside. In the video, Carol Stream police shows
 the body camera of every officer in the apartment.

<p> Footage from the first officer that entered the bedroom where Goodlow was is
 shown second. It shows the moments after a shot was fired and the officer
 yelled "Oh fuck!" and "No, no no stop, stop" at other officers. His direction
 to "stop" was declared after a second gunshot was fired. There are no
 indications that Goodlow was armed.

<p> The Carol Stream Police Department confirmed that all officers' body cameras
 were activated during the incident. "The video footage that is being released
 today represents all of the body worn camera recordings that captured the
 complete interaction between Mr. Goodlow and Carol Stream police officers
 that day. The totality of the video, including the events that occurred
 before and after the shooting, will be released at a later date pursuant to
 the completion of the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office review. Once
 the investigation is completed by the Public Integrity Team, the State's
 Attorney's Office will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all forensic
 evidence, witness accounts, and officer statements to make a determination
 regarding the actions of those involved," A statement on the Carol Stream
 Police Department Facebook page reads in part.

<p> Goodlow was transported to Central DuPage Hospital where he was pronounced
 dead. The shooting remains under investigation.

<p> His family held a press conference at 5:15 p.m. Friday with their legal
 representation, civil rights attorney Andrew Stroth. Goodlow's family and
 social justice activist Rabbi Michael Ben Yosef organized a vigil Friday
 evening to remember him. ###
