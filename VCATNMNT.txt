----------
    Jesus challenges the Pharisees to point out His sin. They remain
    silent. They cannot judge Him guilty of sin, so they instad call Him a
    demon-possessed Samaritan. Jesus is the sinless sacrificial lamb. He is
    the unblemished passover sacrifice to atone for the sin of the world.
    In spite of the fact that scripture points to Him, that they have
    witnessed His miracles, and they see He is without sin in His life and
    teaching they refuse to believe.

    Jesus' death for the sins of the sheep as the Good Shepherd is not
    simply a noble example for people to follow, so that we are more
    self-sacrificing and loving toward our neighbor. Jesus is
    simultaneously the Good Shepherd and the Passover Lamb of God that
    takes away the sin of the world.

    Jesus says that there are other sheep who are not of this fold who hear
    His voice, and for whom He dies. These are the Gentiles. The Jews
    thought that salvation was only for them. He shows in John 10 that this
    isn't true. The salvation of the sheep is a work of the Good Shepherd.
    The sheep are powerless to fight the wolf, and it doesn't matter which
    sheep fold they are a part of.

    normally expected to sacrifice his life doing so. The Good Shepherd,
    however, lays down His life for His sheep. The Good Shepherd, Jesus,
    dies to atone for the sin of the sheep, the people of the world.

    Psalm 91 is, foremost, a messianic psalm. Who but Christ is He who
    dwells in the shelter of the Most High? Who but Christ is protected
    from death until the proper time, while suffering the evils of this
    fallen world? Christ is also the one who, by His sacrificial death,
    trod upon the lion and the cobra; who trampled the great lion and the
    serpent, that is death and the devil.

How Are We Justified?
Hodgkins, IL 
----------
    If the animal sacrifices of the old testament can't remove man's sin,
    how were the old testament saints justified? They were justified the
    same way we are: by the grace of God through faith in Christ alone for
    the forgiveness of sins. Their faith, like Abraham's, and ours, is
    counted to them as righteousness. The animal sacrifices were type and
    shadow of Jesus' true, once-for-all atoning sacrifice.

Something Better

----------
    We have something better than the old testament types and shadows. We
    have their fulfillment in Jesus' atoning sacrifice on the cross. We can
    come to God because we are connected to Christ in our baptism. We can
    count ourselves dead to sin, even though we must still contend with our
    sinful flesh. We have, as the author of Hebrews writes, sprinkled
    hearts and bodies that have been washed.

Jesus Confronts the People
Hodgkins, IL
----------
    After the feeding of the 5,000, Jesus confronts the people. He explains
    that He is the fulfillment of the sign God performed through Moses in
    the wilderness by giving the people manna to eat. He tells them that He
    is the True Bread from heaven. He would win forgivness and life for
    mankind by His death on the cross. He would deliver those gifts to men
    when they eat the bread from heaven - His body and blood. Jesus Himself
    calls His flesh real food, and His blood real drink. It is the food of
    immortality that gives eternal life. All who eat it will be raised to
    life on the Last Day.

    Jesus is indeed able to save forever those who come to God through

    Our imperfection should drive us to despair over our sin, not to try
    harder to earn God's favor. We must see that we can't attain God's
    standard because of our corruption. We are beggars, dependent on His
    mercy. He shows us that mercy in the crucified Christ, who for the joy
    set before Him endured the cross, scorning its shame. Christ kept the
    perfect standard we could not because He is God in human flesh. He died
    as the sacrifice for our sin. He clothes us with His righteousness so
    we may enter His kingdom.

God Overcomes Temptation for Us
Hodgkins, IL
----------
    We can't overcome temptation on our own. We needed to have God do it
    for us. God took on flesh in the Blessed Virgin's womb to become man,
    and He went on to defeat Satan at the cross. He overcame temptation and
    sin so that when we are connected to Christ by our baptism, His
    righteousness would also belong to us.

    God's glory departed from Israel because of their unfaithfulness. It
    would not return until God Himself came to be Israel's Good Shepherd in
    the person of Jesus. He would call His sheep from their scattered
    places, Jew and Gentile alike. He would lead them into green pastures,
    through the valley of the shadow of death and feed them the bread of
    heaven. He saves them from sin, death, and the devil by laying down His
    life for them. He gives them eternal life by connecting them to His
    resurrection through their baptism, the washing of water and the word.

The LORD Will Provide
Hodgkins, IL
----------
    When Abraham offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice in obedience to God's
    command, God provided a man as a substitute. Abraham named the mountain
    "The LORD will provide." This foreshadows that God would provide a
    substitutionary sacrifice for man's sin on the mountain. It would be
    His Son, His Only Son, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the
    world.

----------
    We don't know what Jesus looked like. Because of this, culture fills in
    the gaps. This is appropriate, since Jesus belongs to all people of all
    culutres, of all time. Scripture calls Him humble, and perhaps even
    unappealing, though this might be referring to Jesus as He was on the
    cross. The cross as an instrument of death is ugly. But, the cross upon
    which Jesus was mutilated and disfigured is beautiful. The bloody and
    beaten Jesus is beautiful. He is the love of God manifest for us.

    Luther asserts that the work of salvation is finished by Christ at the
    cross. It was there that Jesus became the once-for-all sacrifice for
    the sin of the world. That forgiveness of sins, and the eternal life it
    brings, can only come to us through God's word. That's why He delivers
    His word to us in different ways: through preaching, through the word
    joined to water in baptism, through the word joined to bread and wine
    in the Supper. A sacrament is nothing else than God's word joined to a
    physical element. The sacraments are means for delivering the word of
    God to us.

    The Church is the place where we receive the forgivness of sins. And,
    even though we continue to struggle with sin, in the Church we have
    uninterrupted forgiveness because of our faith in Christ's vicarious
    atonement. God delivers this forgiveness to us in Word and Sacrament.
    We put ourselves outside the Church when we try to earn God's
    forgivness, rather than receive it through His designated means.

Lecture: The Lord's Supper Three Types of Death
Fort Wayne, IN: Concordia Theological Seminary.
----------
    There are three types of death described in Holy Scripture: physical,
    spiritual, and eternal. Physical death is the separation of body and
    soul. Spiritual death is to be dead in sin and separated by God. It is
    not believing God's words of promise. Eternal death is to be cast into
    hell and suffer eternal separation from God. Jesus, as part of His
    salvific work, suffered both physical and spiritual death for us.

    Part of taking Holy Communion is to proclaim the Lord's Death. Why did
    He die? Jesus died as the propitiation for our sins, and not ours only,
    but for the whole world. By the public act of eating the Lord's Supper,
    we proclaim that Christ died for us, in our place, defeating sin,
    death, and the devil.

    When He finished His work of creation, God declared that it was good.
    When man sinned in the garden, sin and death corrupted that good
    creation. Since God is not a liar, He had to redeem His creation in an
    irreversible way for justice's sake; for the sake of His own name. He
    did this by taking on human flesh, keeping the law, suffering and dying
    in man's place on the cross, and rising from the dead for our
    justification.

----------
    If there are some men who are not covered by the vicarious atonement of
    Christ, then no man can be certain that he is covered by it. Such is
    the terrifying uncertainty that arises out of the Calvinist teaching of
    double-predestination. Even among Calvinists, however, the Church still
    exists. Where the Law is preached, and men who recognize and repent of
    their sins are directed to the Gospel, the Holy Spirit will make
    Christians through the preaching of the Word.

    It is no contradiction for Jesus to say that the Father is greater than
    Him at one point, and later that He and the Father are one. It is
    merely a duality. Christ is true God, begotten of the Father from
    eternity; He is also true man, born of the Virgin Mary. In the first
    sense He is equal to the Father. In the second, in His state of
    humiliation, as He is incarnate to be the sacrifice for sin, the Father
    is superior to Him.

    this statement may be to Lutherans. This means, of course, those who

    The Roman Catholic Church confesses the two doctrines necessary to be
    the Chruch. These are the diety of Christ, and Christ's vicarious

    of good works to merit forgiveness. Rome also condemns those who preach
    the forgivness of sins by the grace of God alone, through faith in
    Christ. By so doing, Pieper says, Rome effectively excommunicates the
