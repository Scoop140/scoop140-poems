<h2> Thoughts on JB Pritzker's Statement for 'Abortion Provider's Appretiation Day'</h2>

<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/650a37fa67c0c923e6eff5e9/9101ef10-900b-4c02-9fba-01ac1f82f547/JB_Hug_Purple_Website.png?format=750w" height="200" width="300" alt="Gov. Pritzker hugs a supporter.">

<h4><em>Monday, March 11, 2024</em></h4>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JBPritzker/status/1766858631675257137">JB Prtizker made a video celebrating something called "Abortion Provider's Appreciation Day."</a> As if it wasn't ghoulish and Orwellian enough to celebrate abortionists who help women exercise their "bodily autonomy," as he said, he also lauded abortionists for helping women make medical decisions about "their own bodies."</p>

<p>Democrats can't be this obtuse. They cannot possibly misunderstand the position of pro-life advocates. The problem isn't that women shouldn't be allowed to make medical decisions about their own bodies; the problem is that there is more than one body involved. This is something the Democrats refuse to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Human beings are human beings from the time of conception. That means that, from conception, we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. Among those rights are the right to life, to liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness. The fact that a human is located inside a womb, is physically and mentally underdeveloped, is unable to live on his own and can't protect and provide for himself is not excuse to allow the indiscirminate killing of these human beings without just cause.</p>

<p>That even goes for women who reall want to exercise their bodily autonomy.</p>

<p>Abortion isn't a private decision. It involves at least two human persons. It isn't healthcare. It isn't a choice. It is killing a human being.</p>

<p> We Christians need to redouble our efforts to rid our country of this barbaric practice. We need to continue our work to help women who have had abortions cope, and to understand that there is forgiveness for this, and for all sins in or Lord Jesus Christ. Those women who are pregnant we must help and support in every way possible.</p>

<p>And we must pray. We must pray for our leaders: that they would fight to protect the lives and rights of all people, no matter their circumstance, and not matter how inconvenient. We must pray for the women of America: that they would embrace and protect the babies they carry inside them; that they would see life as the gift of a creative and merciful God who Himself came to earth and took on human flesh in the womb of the Virgin, in order that He might live, suffer, and die on the cross to redeem mankind from sin and death; that they would resist the wicked propaganda that the godless Left, which pretends to champion women by giving them false autonomy and perception of power, but really diminishes and enslaves them. And, by counting as worthless the most vulnerable among us, they diminish the value and rights of all human beings.</p>

<h2>Steadfast Lutherans to Host Conference</h2>

<h5>Monday, March 11, 2024</h5>

<p>The Law of God Is Good and Wise</p>

<p>There has been much disagreement in American Lutheranism concerning the role of the Law in the Church. Are Lutherans truly “weak on sanctification”? Should there be exhortation in preaching? Do real Lutherans believe in a third use of the Law? What is so bad about antinomianism? How far have we caved to the indulgence and lawlessness of the world? What does true Law and Gospel preaching look like?</p>

<p>These debates have troubled the Missouri Synod in recent years. Thankfully, we can look to the Scriptures and remember how our forefathers in the faith dealt with similar challenges. Over two days, April 12th and 13th, at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Collinsville, IL we will learn about and discuss the Law of God.  This conference is for both laity and pastors. Come join us for good theology, fellowship, and maybe even a little fun!</p>  

<p>Speakers and Preachers: Pr. Benjamin Ball; Rev. John Hill; Rev. Dr. Scott Murray; Rev. Dr. David Petersen; Rev. David Ramirez; Rev. Dr. Peter Scaer; Rev. Joshua Scheer; Rev. Mark Surburg; Pr. Michael Walther; Pr. William Weedon; and, Rev. Todd Wilken</p>

<h2>Ex-McCook Police Chief Sentenced in Extortion Case</h2>
<h5>Saturday, March 2, 2024</h5>
<p> Mario DePasquale, the former police chief of McCook, was sentenced last week
 to more than two years in federal prison after pleading guilty last year to
 conspiring with the village's former mayor to extort two businessmen out of
 tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p> DePasquale, 50, was sentenced February 21 to 27 months in prison by U.S.
 District Judge Elaine Bucklo.</p>

<p> DePasquale was charged in 2020 as part of a sprawling federal corruption
 probe that also ensnared his former boss, McCook Mayor Jeffrey Tobolski, as
 well as other suburban mayors and Democratic power players.</p>
