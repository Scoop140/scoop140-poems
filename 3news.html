<h2>Steadfast Lutherans to Host Conference</h2>

<h5>Monday, March 11, 2024</h5>

<p>The Law of God Is Good and Wise</p>

<p>There has been much disagreement in American Lutheranism concerning the role of the Law in the Church. Are Lutherans truly “weak on sanctification”? Should there be exhortation in preaching? Do real Lutherans believe in a third use of the Law? What is so bad about antinomianism? How far have we caved to the indulgence and lawlessness of the world? What does true Law and Gospel preaching look like?</p>

<p>These debates have troubled the Missouri Synod in recent years. Thankfully, we can look to the Scriptures and remember how our forefathers in the faith dealt with similar challenges. Over two days, April 12th and 13th, at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Collinsville, IL we will learn about and discuss the Law of God.  This conference is for both laity and pastors. Come join us for good theology, fellowship, and maybe even a little fun!</p>  

<p>Speakers and Preachers: Pr. Benjamin Ball; Rev. John Hill; Rev. Dr. Scott Murray; Rev. Dr. David Petersen; Rev. David Ramirez; Rev. Dr. Peter Scaer; Rev. Joshua Scheer; Rev. Mark Surburg; Pr. Michael Walther; Pr. William Weedon; and, Rev. Todd Wilken</p>

<h2>Ex-McCook Police Chief Sentenced in Extortion Case</h2>
<h5>Saturday, March 2, 2024</h5>
<p> Mario DePasquale, the former police chief of McCook, was sentenced last week
 to more than two years in federal prison after pleading guilty last year to
 conspiring with the village's former mayor to extort two businessmen out of
 tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p> DePasquale, 50, was sentenced February 21 to 27 months in prison by U.S.
 District Judge Elaine Bucklo.</p>

<p> DePasquale was charged in 2020 as part of a sprawling federal corruption
 probe that also ensnared his former boss, McCook Mayor Jeffrey Tobolski, as
 well as other suburban mayors and Democratic power players.</p>
