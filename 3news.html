<h2>Hodgkins Courts Napleton Auto Group</h2>
<h5>Monday, March 4, 2024</h5><bk>
<p>The Village of Hodgkins is currently in negotiations to bring the Napleton Auto Group into the village. According to sources inside the village hall, the administration is hoping to bring a Napleton Group Genesis dealership to town. It is unclear where the new dealership would locate, should the parties come to an agreement. Possibilities include village-owned property at East Ave and Joliet Rd., and the Pep Boys building on La Grange Rd, just north of 63rd St.</p>

<h2>Ex-McCook Police Chief Sentenced in Extortion Case</h2>
<h5>Saturday, March 2, 2024</h5>
<p> Mario DePasquale, the former police chief of McCook, was sentenced last week
 to more than two years in federal prison after pleading guilty last year to
 conspiring with the village's former mayor to extort two businessmen out of
 tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p> DePasquale, 50, was sentenced February 21 to 27 months in prison by U.S.
 District Judge Elaine Bucklo.</p>

<p> DePasquale was charged in 2020 as part of a sprawling federal corruption
 probe that also ensnared his former boss, McCook Mayor Jeffrey Tobolski, as
 well as other suburban mayors and Democratic power players.</p>
